[Task 1] Introduction
#####################

The aim of this room is to provide a beginner's introduction to the basic
principles of networking.

Topics:

	- OSI Model
	- TCP/IP Model
	- How these models look in practice
	- Introduction to basic networking tools

###################################
[Task 2] The OSI Model: An Overview
###################################


Which layer would choose to send data over TCP or UDP?
------------------------------------------------------

	4 - Transport Layer

Which layer checks received packets to make sure that they haven't been corrupted?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	2 - Data Link Layer

In which layer would data be formatted in preparation for transmission?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	2 - Data Link Layer

Which layer transmits and receives data?
----------------------------------------

	1 - Physical Layer

Which layer encrypts, compresses, or otherwise transforms the initial data to give it a standardised format?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	6 - Presentation Layer

Which layer tracks communications between the host and receiving computers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

	5 - Session Layer

Which layer accepts communication requests from applications?
-------------------------------------------------------------

	7 - Application Layer

Which layer handles logical addressing?
---------------------------------------

	3 - Network Layer

When sending data over TCP, what would you call the "bite-sized" pieces of data?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	segments

[Research] Which layer would the FTP protocol communicate with?
---------------------------------------------------------------

	7 - Application Layer

Which transport layer protocol would be best suited to transmit a live video?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	UDP

[Task 4] Wireshark
##################

=============
Packet Layout
=============
:Prerequisites: Select packet in 1st row
:Location: Middle row

There are 5 pieces of information here.

Frame
-----
:Layer: Physical | Network Interface
:Descr: the size of the packet received in terms of bytes
:Note: Frame # comes from the ordering position in which Wireshark captured it.

Ethernet II
------------
:Layer: Data Link | Network Interface
:Descr: the transmission medium (in this case an Ethernet cable)
:Descr2: source and destination MAC addresses of the request.

Internet Protocol Version 4
----------------------------
:Layer: Network | Internet
:Desc: the source and destination IP addresses of the request.

Transmission Control Protocol
------------------------------
:Layer: Transport | Transport
:Descr: it's telling us that the protocol was TCP (and more!)

Hypertext Transfer Protocol
----------------------------
:Layer: Application | Application
:Descr: This is the HTTP GET request, which is requesting a web page from a remote server.
