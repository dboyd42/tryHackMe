[Task 2] Understanding SMB
**************************

What is SMB?
============

SMB - Server Message Block Protocol - is a client-server communication protocol
used for sharing access to files, printers, serial ports and other resources on
a network. [source]

Servers make file systems and other resources (printers, named pipes, APIs)
available to clients on the network. Client computers may have their own hard
disks, but they also want access to the shared file systems and printers on the
servers.

The SMB protocol is known as a **response-request** protocol, meaning that it
transmits multiple messages between the client and server to establish a
connection. Clients connect to servers using **TCP/IP (actually NetBIOS over
TCP/IP as specified in RFC1001 and RFC1002), NetBEUI or IPX/SPX**.

How does SMB work?
==================

Once they have established a connection, clients can then send commands (SMBs)
to the server that allow them to access shares, open files, read and write
files, and generally do all the sort of things that you want to do with a file
system. However, in the case of SMB, these things are done over the network.

What runs SMB?
==============

Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows 95 have included client and
server SMB protocol support. Samba, an open source server that supports the SMB
protocol, was released for Unix systems.


#. What does SMB stand for?

	- Server Message Block

#. What type of protocol is SMB?

	- request-response

#. What do clients connect to servers using?

	- TCP/IP

#. What systems does Samba run on?

	- UNIX

[Task 3] Enumerating SMB
************************
:prgms: sudo apt install enum4linux

#. Conduct an nmap scan of your choosing, How many ports are open?

	- Don't count the 'filtered' ports
	- 3

#. What ports is SMB running on?

	- 139/445

#. Let's get started with Enum4Linux, conduct a full basic enumeration. For starters, what is the workgroup name?

	- WORKGROUP

#. What comes up as the name of the machine?

	- POLOSMB
	- Look under OS

#. What operating system version is running?

	- 6.1

#. What share sticks out as something we might want to investigate?

	- profiles
