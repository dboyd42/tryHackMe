Accessing
---------

https://127.0.0.1:8834

The port 8834 is in LISTENing mode, as it should be.  We access the Nessus web
interface by connecting to an address https://127.0.0.1:8834/ in a web browser.
When opening Nessus in a web browser, it will take some time to initialize, so
we'll have to wait a little bit.  After initialization, the Nessus login screen
will pop-up, where we can login with out **admin** username we previously
created.
