  Tests a web server for vulnerability to the Slowloris DoS attack without
  actually launching a DoS attack.

  Slowloris was described at Defcon 17 by RSnake
  (see http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/).

  This script opens two connections to the server, each without the final CRLF.
  After 10 seconds, second connection sends additional header. Both connections
  then wait for server timeout.  If second connection gets a timeout 10 or more
  seconds after the first one, we can conclude that sending additional header
  prolonged its timeout and that the server is vulnerable to slowloris DoS
  attack.

  A "LIKELY VULNERABLE" result means a server is subject to timeout-extension
  attack, but depending on the http server's architecture and resource limits, a
  full denial-of-service is not always possible. Complete testing requires
  triggering the actual DoS condition and measuring server responsiveness.

  You can specify custom http User-agent field with <code>http.useragent</code>
  script argument.
