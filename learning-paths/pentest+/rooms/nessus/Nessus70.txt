Nessus Professional, the industry’s most widely deployed vulnerability assessment solution helps you
reduce your organization’s attack surface and ensure compliance. Nessus features high-speed asset
discovery, configuration auditing, target profiling, malware detection, sensitive data discovery, and
more.
Nessus supports more technologies than competitive solutions, scanning operating systems, network
devices, hypervisors, databases, web servers, and critical infrastructure for vulnerabilities, threats, and
compliance violations.
With the world’s largest continuously-updated library of vulnerability and configuration checks, and
the support of Tenable, Inc.’s expert vulnerability research team, Nessus sets the standard for vulnerability scanning speed and accuracy.

Nessus Professional Product Page

Nessus Agents
Nessus Agents, available with Tenable.io and Nessus Manager, increase scan flexibility by making it
easy to scan assets without needing ongoing host credentials or assets that are offline, as well as
enable large-scale concurrent scanning with little network impact.
Nessus Agents are lightweight, low-footprint programs that you install locally on hosts to supplement
traditional network-based scanning or to provide visibility into gaps that are missed by traditional
scanning. Nessus Agents collect vulnerability, compliance, and system data, and report that information back to a manager for analysis. With Nessus Agents, you extend scan flexibility and coverage. You
can scan hosts without using credentials, as well as offline assets and endpoints that intermittently
connect to the internet. You can also run large-scale concurrent agent scans with little network impact.
Nessus Agents help you address the challenges of traditional network-based scanning, specifically for
the assets where it's impossible or nearly impossible to consistently collect information about your
organization's security posture. Traditional scanning typically occurs at selected intervals or during designated windows and requires systems to be accessible when a scan is executed. If laptops or other
transient devices are not accessible when a scan is executed, they are excluded from the scan, leaving
you blind to vulnerabilities on those devices. Nessus Agents help reduce your organization’s attack surface by scanning assets that are off the network or powered-down during scheduled assessments or
by scanning other difficult-to-scan assets.
Once installed on servers, portable devices, or other assets found in today’s complex IT environments,
Nessus Agents identify vulnerabilities, policy violations, misconfigurations, and malware on the hosts
where they are installed and report results back to the managing product. You can manage Nessus
Agents with Nessus Manager or Tenable.io (including Tenable.io on-prem).

Nessus Manager
Note: Nessus Manager is no longer sold as of February 1, 2018. For existing customers, service will continue to be provided through the duration of your contract. For prospective customers, please consider
Tenable.io for your vulnerability management needs.

Nessus Manager combines the powerful detection, scanning, and auditing features of Nessus, the
world’s most widely deployed vulnerability scanner, with extensive management and collaboration
functions to reduce your attack surface.
Nessus Manager enables the sharing of resources including Nessus scanners, scan schedules, policies,
and scan results among multiple users or groups. Users can engage and share resources and responsibilities with their co-workers; system owners, internal auditors, risk and compliance personnel, IT
administrators, network admins and security analysts. These collaborative features reduce the time
and cost of security scanning and compliance auditing by streamlining scanning, malware and misconfiguration discovery, and remediation.
Nessus Manager protects physical, virtual, mobile and cloud environments. Nessus Manager is available for on-premises deployment or from the cloud, as Tenable.io. Nessus Manager supports the
widest range of systems, devices and assets, and with both agent-less and Nessus Agent deployment
options, easily extends to mobile, transient and other hard-to-reach environments.

Hardware Requirements
Enterprise networks can vary in performance, capacity, protocols, and overall activity. Resource
requirements to consider for Nessus deployments include raw network speed, the size of the network
being monitored, and the configuration of Nessus.
Note: The following recommendations are guidelines for the minimum hardware allocations. Certain
types of scans are more resource intensive. If you run complex scans, especially those with credentials,
you may require additional disk space, memory, and processing power.

Nessus Scanners and Nessus Professional
The following table lists the hardware requirements for Nessus scanners and Nessus Professional.

Scenario

Minimum Recommended Hardware

Scanning up to 50,000 hosts per
scan

Virtual Machines
Nessus can be installed on a Virtual Machine that meets the same requirements. If your virtual
machine is using Network Address Translation (NAT) to reach the network, many of the Nessus vulnerability checks, host enumeration, and operating system identification are negatively affected.

Nessus Agents
Nessus Agents are designed to be lightweight and to use only minimal system resources. Generally, a
Nessus Agent uses 40 MB of RAM (all pageable). A Nessus Agent uses almost no CPU while idle, but is
designed to use up to 100% of CPU when available during jobs.
For more information on Nessus Agent resource usage, see Agent Software Footprint and Agent

Host System Utilization.
The following table outlines the minimum recommended hardware for operating a Nessus Agent. Nessus Agents can be installed on a virtual machine that meets the same requirements specified.

Operating
System

Supported Versions
Tip: Windows Server 2008 R2’s bundled version of Microsoft IE does not interface
with a Java installation properly. This causes Nessus to not perform as expected in
some situations: Microsoft’s policy recommends not using MSIE on server operating
systems.
For increased performance and scan reliability when installing on a Windows platform, Tenable highly recommends that Nessus be installed on a server product from
the Microsoft Windows family such as Windows Server 2008 R2.

Licensing Requirements
Nessus is available to operate either as a subscription or managed by Tenable.sc. Nessus requires a
plugin feed Activation Code to operate in subscription mode. This code identifies which version of Nessus you are licensed to install and use, and if applicable, how many IP addresses can be scanned, how
many remote scanners can be linked to Nessus, and how many Nessus Agents can be linked to Nessus
Manager. Nessus Manager licenses are specific to your deployment size, especially for large deployments or deployments with multiple Nessus Manager instances. Discuss your requirements with your
Tenable Customer Success Manager.
It is recommended that you obtain the Activation Code before starting the installation process, as it is
required before you can set up Nessus.
Additionally, your activation code:
l

is a one-time code, unless your license or subscription changes, at which point a new activation
code will be issued to you.

l

must be used with the Nessus installation within 24 hours.

l

cannot be shared between scanners.

l

is not case sensitive.

l

is required to manage Nessus offline.
Note: For more information about managing Nessus offline, refer to the Nessus User Guide.

You may purchase a Nessus subscription through the Tenable, Inc. online store at https://store.ten-

able.com/ or via a purchase order through Authorized Nessus Partners. You will then receive an
Activation Code from Tenable, Inc.. This code will be used when configuring your copy of Nessus for
updates.
Note: See the Obtain an Activation Code page to obtain an Activation Code.

If you are using Tenable.sc to manage your Nessus scanners, the Activation Code and plugin updates
are managed from Tenable.sc. You must start Nessus before it communicates with Tenable.sc, which it
normally does not do without a valid Activation Code and plugins. To have Nessus ignore this requirement and start (so that it can get the information from Tenable.sc), when you register your scanner,
select Managed by SecurityCenter.

Deployment Considerations
When deploying Nessus, knowledge of routing, filters, and firewall policies is often helpful. Deploying
behind a NAT device is not desirable unless it is scanning the internal network. Any time a vulnerability
scan flows through a NAT device or application proxy of some sort, the check can be distorted and a
false positive or negative can result.
In addition, if the system running Nessus has personal or desktop firewalls in place, these tools can
drastically limit the effectiveness of a remote vulnerability scan. Host-based firewalls can interfere with
network vulnerability scanning. Depending on your firewall’s configuration, it may prevent, distort, or
hide the probes of a Nessus scan.
Certain network devices that perform stateful inspection, such as firewalls, load balancers, and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems, may react negatively when a scan is conducted through them. Nessus has a number of tuning options that can help reduce the impact of scanning through such devices,
but the best method to avoid the problems inherent in scanning through such network devices is to
perform a credentialed scan.
If you configure Nessus Manager for agent management, Tenable does not recommend using Nessus
Manager as a local scanner. For example, do not configure Tenable.sc scan zones to include Nessus
Manager and avoid running network-based scans directly from Nessus Manager. These configurations
can negatively impact agent scan performance.

Host-Based Firewalls
Port 8834
The Nessus user interface uses port 8834. If not already open, open port 8834 by consulting your firewall vendor's documentation for configuration instructions.

Allow Connections
If your Nessus server is configured on a host with 3rd-party firewall such as ZoneAlarm or Windows
firewall, you must configure it to allow connections from the IP addresses of the clients using Nessus.

Nessus and FirewallD
Nessus can be configured to work with FirewallD. When Nessus is installed on RHEL 7, CentOS 7, and
Fedora 20+ systems using firewalld, firewalld can be configured with the Nessus service and Nessus port.
To open the ports required for Nessus, use the following commands:
>> firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nessus
>> firewall-cmd --reload

IPv6 Support
Nessus supports scanning of IPv6 based resources. Many operating systems and devices ship with IPv6
support enabled by default. To perform scans against IPv6 resources, at least one IPv6 interface must
be configured on the host where Nessus is installed, and Nessus must be on an IPv6 capable network
(Nessus cannot scan IPv6 resources over IPv4, but it can enumerate IPv6 interfaces via credentialed
scans over IPv4). Both full and compressed IPv6 notation is supported when initiating scans.
Scanning IPv6 Global Unicast IP address ranges is not supported unless the IPs are entered separately
(i.e., list format). Nessus does not support ranges expressed as hyphenated ranges or CIDR addresses.
Nessus supports Link-local ranges with the link6 directive as the scan target or local link with eth0.

Virtual Machines
If your virtual machine uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to reach the network, many of Nessus
vulnerability checks, host enumeration, and operating system identification are negatively affected.

- 30 -

Antivirus Software
Due to the large number of TCP connections generated during a scan, some anti-virus software packages may classify Nessus as a worm or a form of malware.
If your anti-virus software gives a warning, select Allow to let Nessus continue scanning.
If your anti-virus package has an option to add processes to an exception list, add nessusd.exe and

nessus-service.exe.

Security Warnings
By default, Nessus is installed and managed using HTTPS and SSL uses port 8834. The default installation of Nessus uses a self-signed SSL certificate.
During the web-based portion of the Nessus installation, the following message regarding SSL
appears:

You are likely to get a security alert from your web browser saying that the SSL certificate is invalid. You may either choose to temporarily accept the risk, or you can
obtain a valid SSL certificate from a registrar.
This information refers to a security related message you encounter when accessing the Nessus UI
(https://[server IP]:8834).

Example Security Warning
l

a connection privacy problem

l

an untrusted site

Install a Nessus Agent on Windows
Caution: If you install a Nessus Agent on a system where an existing Nessus Agent, Manager, or Scanner is running nessusd, the installation process kills all other nessusd processes. You may lose scan
data as a result.
Note: This procedure describes deploying Nessus Agents via the command line. You can also deploy
Nessus Agents with a standard Windows service such as Active Directory (AD), Systems Management
Server (SMS), or other software delivery system for MSI packages. For more information on deploying
via these methods, see the appropriate vendor's documentation.

Before You Begin
Retrieve the Nessus Agents linking key.

Deploy and Link via the Command Line
You can deploy and link Nessus Agents via the command line. For example:
msiexec /i NessusAgent-<version number>-x64.msi NESSUS_GROUPS="Agent Group Name"
NESSUS_SERVER="192.168.0.1:8834" NESSUS_
KEY=00abcd00000efgh11111i0k222lmopq3333st4455u66v777777w88xy9999zabc00 /qn

For Nessus Agents 7.0.3 or later, you can install the Nessus Agent on a system even if it is offline. Add
the command line option NESSUS_OFFLINE_INSTALL="yes" to the command line input. The Nessus
Agent will periodically attempt to link itself to either Tenable.io or Nessus Manager. If the agent cannot
connect to the controller then it retries every hour, and if the agent can connect to the controller but
the link fails then it retries every 24 hours.
Additionally, you can install a full plugins set before linking for the purpose of reducing the bandwidth
impact during a mass installation. Add the command line option NESSUS_PLUGINS_FILEPATH-

H="C:\path\to\plugins_set.tgz" where plugins_set.tgz is a recent plugins set tarball less than
five days old. A stale plugins set older than five days will force a full plugins download to occur. You
can download a recent plugins set from the Nessus Agents download page.
Note: The NESSUS_GROUPS parameter accepts group names. Quotations are necessary only when listing
multiple groups, or one group with spaces in its name. For example:

Transfer Activation Code
In Nessus Professional 7.0 or later, you can use an activation code on multiple systems. This allows you
to easily transfer a Nessus license from one system to another without resetting your activation code
each time.
When you transfer the activation code to a system, it becomes the active instance of Nessus for that
license. Only the most recently activated system can receive plugin updates. All previous instances of
Nessus with that activation code still function, but cannot receive plugin updates. On inactive
instances, the following error message appears: Access to the feed has been denied, likely due

to an invalid or transferred license code.
To transfer an activation code, use one of the following procedures on the system that you want to
make the active instance of Nessus.

Nessus User Interface
Activate a new Nessus instance
1. Install Nessus as described in the appropriate procedure for your operating system.
2. Access the system in a web browser.
3. In the Create an account window, type a username and password.

5. In the Register your scanner window, in the Scanner Type drop-down box, select Nessus
Home, Professional, or Manager.
6. In the Activation Code box, type your activation code.
7. Click Continue.
Nessus finishes the installation process, which may take several minutes. Once installation is
complete, the license is active on this instance of Nessus.

Manage Nessus Offline
To manage Nessus offline, you need two computers: the Nessus server, which is not connected to the
internet, and another computer that is connected to the internet.

Scenario 1: New Nessus Install
If you want to install Nessus, but, for security purposes, the server is not connected to the internet,
then follow the steps to install Nessus while offline. This process downloads and installs Nessus plugins on the offline Nessus server.

Install Nessus Offline
A Nessus Offline registration is suitable for computers that will be running Nessus, but are not connected to the internet. To ensure that Nessus has the most up-to-date plugins, Nessus servers not connected to the internet must perform these specific steps to register Nessus.
This process requires the use of two computers: the computer where you are installing Nessus, which
is not connected to the internet, and another computer that is connected to the internet.
For the instructions below, we'll use computers A (offline Nessus server) and B (online computer) as
examples.

1. During the browser portion of the Nessus installation, in the Registration drop-down, select
Offline.
2. Once Offline is selected, the page displays a unique Challenge Code. In the example below, the
challenge code is: aaaaaa11b2222cc33d44e5f6666a777b8cc99999.
This challenge code is used in the next step.

3. (Optional) Configure your Nessus setup to use Custom Settings.

Generate the License
1. On a system with internet access (B), navigate to the Nessus Offline Registration Page.
2. In the top field, type the challenge code that was displayed on the Nessus Product Registration screen.
Example Challenge Code: aaaaaa11b2222cc33d44e5f6666a777b8cc99999

3. Next, where prompted, type your Nessus activation code.
Example Activation Code: AB-CDE-1111-F222-3E4D-55E5-CD6F

4. Click the Submit button.
The Offline Update Page displays and includes the following elements:
l

Custom URL: The custom URL displayed downloads a compressed plugins file. This file is
used by Nessus to obtain plugin information. This URL is specific to your Nessus license

Generate Challenge Code
Before performing offline update operations, you may need to generate a unique identifier on the Nessus server. This identifier is called a challenge code.
Whereas an activation code is used when performing Nessus operations when connected to the internet, a license is used when performing offline operations; the generated challenge code enables you
to view and use your license for offline operations.

Steps
1. On the offline system running Nessus (A), open a command prompt.
2. Use the nessuscli fetch --challenge command specific to your operating system.
Platform

Command

Linux

# /opt/nessus/sbin/nessuscli fetch --challenge

FreeBSD

# /usr/local/nessus/sbin/nessuscli fetch --challenge

Mac OS X

# /Library/Nessus/run/sbin/nessuscli fetch --challenge

Windows

C:\Program Files\Tenable\Nessus>nessuscli.exe fetch --challenge

3. Copy the alphanumeric challenge code.
Example Challenge Code:
aaaaaa11b2222cc33d44e5f6666a777b8cc99999

Generate Your License
By default, when Nessus is installed, your license is hidden, and is automatically registered. This
license is not viewable.
However, in the event that your Nessus Server is not connected to the internet (i.e., is offline) a license
must be generated. This license is unique to your Nessus product and cannot be shared.
Your license is a text-based file that contains a string of alphanumeric characters. The license is created and based on your unique generated challenge code.

1. On a system with internet access (B), navigate to the Nessus Offline Registration Page.
2. Where prompted, type in your challenge code.
Example Challenge Code: aaaaaa11b2222cc33d44e5f6666a777b8cc99999

3. Next, where prompted, enter your Nessus activation code.
Example Activation Code: AB-CDE-1111-F222-3E4D-55E5-CD6F

4. Select Submit.
At the bottom of the resulting web page, there is an embedded nessus.license file that
includes the license text string displayed.

5. Next, Download and Copy License File (nessus.license).

URL: https://plugins.nessus.org/v2/offline.php.
If you are using a version of Nessus 6.2 or earlier, you must use the information and instructions displayed on the following URL: https://plugins.nessus.org/offline.php.

1. While still using the computer with internet access (B), select the on-screen nessus.license link.

Scan and Policy Settings
Scan or Policy Settings are organized into collections of configuration items, specifically Basic, Dis-

covery, Assessment, Report, and Advanced settings. Each of these collections are subdivided into
further sections. For example, the Basic settings include the General, Schedule, Notifications, and

Permissions sections. Additionally, the sections may contain groups of related configuration items.
For example, the Host Discovery section contains the General Settings, Ping Methods, Fragile

Devices, Wake-on-LAN, and Network Type groups.
The following sections of the documentation are organized to reflect the interface. For example, if you
wanted to find information about the General section ( 3 in the previous image) of the Basic settings ( 2
in the previous image) that appears when you select the Settings tab ( 1 in the previous image), you
should locate the table labeled General in the Basic topic. The tables include subheadings to reflect
groups of related configuration items that appear in a particular section.

The following settings exist for each policy, though available configuration items may vary based on
the selected template:

Description
This option enables Nessus to ping remote hosts on multiple ports
to determine if they are alive. When set to On, General Settings
and Ping Methods appear.
Note: To scan VMware guest systems, Ping the remote host must
be set to Off.

General Settings
Use Fast Network Discovery

Disabled

If a host responds to ping, Nessus attempts to avoid false positives,
performing additional tests to verify the response did not come
from a proxy or load balancer. Fast network discovery bypasses
those additional tests.

ARP

Enabled

Ping a host using its hardware address via Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). This only works on a local network.

TCP

Enabled

Ping a host using TCP.

Destination
ports (TCP)

Built-In

Destination ports can be configured to use specific ports for TCP
ping. This specifies the list of ports that are checked via TCP ping.

ICMP

Enabled

Ping a host using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).

Assume ICMP
unreachable
from the gateway means the
host is down

Disabled

Assume ICMP unreachable from the gateway means the host is
down When a ping is sent to a host that is down, its gateway may
return an ICMP unreachable message. When this option is enabled,
when Nessus receives an ICMP Unreachable message, it considers
the targeted host dead. This is to help speed up discovery on some

networks.
Note: Some firewalls and packet filters use this same behavior for
hosts that are up, but connected to a port or protocol that is
filtered. With this option enabled, this leads to the scan considering the host is down when it is indeed up.

Maximum number of retries

2

Specifies the number of attempts to retry pinging the remote host.

UDP

Disabled

Ping a host using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
UDP is a stateless protocol, meaning that communication is not performed with handshake dialogues. UDP-based communication is
not always reliable, and because of the nature of UDP services and
screening devices, they are not always remotely detectable.

Scan Network
Printers

Disabled

When enabled, Nessus scans network printers.

Setting

Default

Description
Additionally, you can type a custom range of ports by using a
comma-delimited list of ports or port ranges. For example,

21,23,25,80,110 or 1-1024,8080,9000-9200. If you wanted to
scan all ports excluding port 0, you would type 1-65535.
The custom range specified for a port scan is applied to the protocols you have selected in the Network Port Scanners group of
settings.
If scanning both TCP and UDP, you can specify a split range specific
to each protocol. For example, if you want to scan a different range
of ports for TCP and UDP in the same policy, you would type T:1-

1024,U:300-500.
You can also specify a set of ports to scan for both protocols, as well
as individual ranges for each separate protocol. For example, 1-

1024,T:1024-65535,U:1025.
Local Port Enumerators

This option uses netstat to check for open ports from the local
machine. It relies on the netstat command being available via an SSH
connection to the target. This scan is intended for Linux-based systems and requires authentication credentials.

Description

SYN

Enabled

Use the Nessus SYN scanner to identify open TCP ports on the target
hosts. SYN scans are generally considered to be less intrusive than
TCP scans depending on the security monitoring device, such as a
firewall or Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The scanner sends a SYN
packet to the port, waits for SYN-ACK reply, and determines the port
state based on a reply or lack of reply.

UDP

Disabled

This option engages Nessus built-in UDP scanner to identify open
UDP ports on the targets.
Due to the nature of the protocol, it is generally not possible for a
port scanner to tell the difference between open and filtered UDP
ports. Enabling the UDP port scanner may dramatically increase the
scan time and produce unreliable results. Consider using the netstat
or SNMP port enumeration options instead if possible.

Disabled

This setting manages the combination of argument
values used in the HTTP requests. The default,
without checking this option, is testing one parameter at a time with an attack string, without trying
non-attack variations for additional parameters. For
example, Nessus would attempt

/test.php?arg1=XSS&b=1&c=1, where b and c
allow other values, without testing each combination. This is the quickest method of testing with
the smallest result set generated.
This setting has four options:
l

Test random pairs of parameters: This
form of testing randomly checks a combination of random pairs of parameters. This
is the fastest way to test multiple parameters.

l

Test all pairs of parameters (slow): This
form of testing is slightly slower but more efficient than the one value test. While testing
multiple parameters, it tests an attack string,
variations for a single variable and then use
the first value for all other variables. For
example, Nessus would attempt

/test.php?a=XSS&b=1&c=1&d=1 and then
cycle through the variables so that one is
given the attack string, one is cycled through
all possible values (as discovered during the
mirror process) and any other variables are
given the first value. In this case, Nessus
would never test for /test.php?a-

seeks to create a smaller data set as a tradeoff
for speed, all combinations makes no compromise on time and uses a complete data set
of tests. This testing method may take a long

on the template you select, certain default values may vary.

Setting

Default
Value

Description

General Settings
Enable Safe
Checks

Enabled

When enabled, disables all plugins that may have an adverse effect
on the remote host.

Stop scanning hosts
that become
unresponsive
during the
scan

Disabled

When enabled, Nessus stops scanning if it detects that the host has
become unresponsive. This may occur if users turn off their PCs during a scan, a host has stopped responding after a denial of service
plugin, or a security mechanism (for example, an IDS) has started to
block traffic to a server. Normally, continuing scans on these
machines sends unnecessary traffic across the network and delay the
scan.

Scan IP
addresses in
a random
order

Disabled

By default, Nessus scans a list of IP addresses in sequential order.
When enabled, Nessus scans the list of hosts in a random order
across the entire target IP space. This is typically useful in helping to
distribute the network traffic during large scans.

Slow down
the scan
when network congestion is
detected

Disabled

This enables Nessus to detect when it is sending too many packets
and the network pipe is approaching capacity. If detected, Nessus
throttles the scan to accommodate and alleviate the congestion.
Once the congestion has subsided, Nessus automatically attempts to
use the available space within the network pipe again.

Network
timeout (in
seconds)

5

Specifies the time that Nessus waits for a response from a host
unless otherwise specified within a plugin. If you are scanning over a
slow connection, you may want to set this to a higher number of
seconds.

Max simultaneous
checks per
host

5

Specifies the maximum number of checks a Nessus scanner will perform against a single host at one time.

Credentials
When you configure a scan or policy's Credentials, the Nessus scanner can be granted local access to
scan the target system without requiring an agent. This can facilitate scanning of a very large network
to determine local exposures or compliance violations. As noted, some steps of policy creation may be
optional. Once created, the policy is saved with recommended settings.
Nessus leverages the ability to log into remote Linux hosts via Secure Shell (SSH); and with Windows
hosts, Nessus leverages a variety of Microsoft authentication technologies. Note that Nessus also uses
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to make version and information queries to routers
and switches.
The scan or policy’s Credentials page allows you to configure the Nessus scanner to use authentication credentials during scanning. Configuring credentials allows Nessus to perform a wider variety
of checks that result in more accurate scan results.
Note: By default, when creating credentialed scans or polices, hosts are identified and marked with a
Tenable Asset Identifier (TAI). This globally unique identifier is written to the host's registry or file system and subsequent scans can retrieve and use the TAI.
This option is enabled (by default) or disabled in the Advanced > General Settings of a scan or policy's
configuration settings: Create unique identifier on hosts scanned using credentials

There are several forms of authentication supported including but not limited to databases, SSH, Windows, network devices, patch management servers, and various plaintext authentication protocols.
In addition to operating system credentials, Nessus supports other forms of local authentication.
The following types of credentials are managed in the Credentials section of the scan or policy:
l

Cloud Services

l

Database, which includes MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL, DB2, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server

l

Host, which includes Windows logins, SSH, and SNMPv3

l

Miscellaneous services, which include VMware, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV), IBM
iSeries, Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS, and directory services (ADSI and X.509)

l

Mobile Device Management

l

Patch Management servers

l

Plaintext authentication mechanisms including FTP, HTTP, POP3, and other services

Credentialed scans can perform any operation that a local user can perform. The level of scanning is
dependent on the privileges granted to the user account. The more privileges the scanner has via the
login account (e.g., root or administrator access), the more thorough the scan results.
Note: Nessus opens several concurrent authenticated connections. Ensure that the host being audited
does not have a strict account lockout policy based on concurrent sessions.

SSH
On Linux systems and supported network devices, Nessus uses Secure Shell (SSH) protocol version 2
based programs (e.g., OpenSSH, Solaris SSH, etc.) for host-based checks.
This mechanism encrypts the data in transit to protect it from being viewed by sniffer programs. Nessus supports five types of authentication methods for use with SSH: username and password, public/private keys, digital certificates, and Kerberos.
Users can select SSH settings from the Credentials menu and enter credentials for scanning Linux systems.
These credentials are used to obtain local information from remote Linux systems for patch auditing
or compliance checks.
Note: Non-privileged users with local access on Linux systems can determine basic security issues,
such as patch levels or entries in the /etc/passwd file. For more comprehensive information, such as
system configuration data or file permissions across the entire system, an account with root privileges
is required

Global Credential Settings
There are four settings for SSH credentials that apply to all SSH Authentication methods.

Option
known_hosts
file

Default
Value
none

Description
If an SSH known_hosts file is available and provided as part of
the Global Credential Settings of the scan policy in the known_

hosts file field, Nessus will only attempt to log into hosts in this
file. This can ensure that the same username and password you
are using to audit your known SSH servers is not used to attempt a
log into a system that may not be under your control.
Preferred port

22

This option can be set to direct Nessus to connect to SSH if it is
running on a port other than 22.

Client version

OpenSSH_
5.0

Specifies which type of SSH client Nessus will impersonate while
scanning.

- 156 -

Option
privilege
(experimental)

Default
Value

Description
Nessus attempts to run the scan with an account with lesser privileges, even if the Elevate privileges with option is enabled. If a
command fails, Nessus will escalate privileges. Plugins 102095 and
102094 report which plugins ran with or without escalated privileges.
Note: Enabling this option may increase scan run time by up to
30%.

Public Key
Public Key Encryption, also referred to as asymmetric key encryption, provides a more secure authentication mechanism by the use of a public and private key pair. In asymmetric cryptography, the public
key is used to encrypt data and the private key is used to decrypt it. The use of public and private keys
is a more secure and flexible method for SSH authentication. Nessus supports both DSA and RSA key
formats.
Like Public Key Encryption, Nessus supports RSA and DSA OpenSSH certificates. Nessus also requires
the user certificate, which is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), and the user’s private key.
Note: Nessus supports the OpenSSH SSH public key format. Formats from other SSH applications,
including PuTTY and SSH Communications Security, must be converted to OpenSSH public key format.

The most effective credentialed scans are when the supplied credentials have root privileges. Since
many sites do not permit a remote login as root, Nessus can invoke su, sudo, su+sudo, dzdo, .k5login,
or pbrun with a separate password for an account that has been set up to have su or sudo privileges.
In addition, Nessus can escalate privileges on Cisco devices by selecting Cisco ‘enable’ or .k5login for
Kerberos logins.
Note: Nessus supports the blowfish-cbc, aes-cbc, and aes-ctr cipher algorithms. Some commercial variants of SSH do not have support for the blowfish algorithm, possibly for export reasons. It is also possible to configure an SSH server to only accept certain types of encryption. Check your SSH server to
ensure the correct algorithm is supported.

Nessus encrypts all passwords stored in policies. However, the use of SSH keys for authentication
rather than SSH passwords is recommended. This helps ensure that the same username and password
you are using to audit your known SSH servers is not used to attempt a log in to a system that may not
be under your control.

Kerberos
Kerberos, developed by MIT’s Project Athena, is a client/server application that uses a symmetric key
encryption protocol. In symmetric encryption, the key used to encrypt the data is the same as the key
used to decrypt the data. Organizations deploy a KDC (Key Distribution Center) that contains all users
and services that require Kerberos authentication. Users authenticate to Kerberos by requesting a TGT
(Ticket Granting Ticket). Once a user is granted a TGT, it can be used to request service tickets from the
KDC to be able to utilize other Kerberos based services. Kerberos uses the CBC (Cipher Block Chain)
DES encryption protocol to encrypt all communications.
Note: You must already have a Kerberos environment established to use this method of authentication.

The Nessus implementation of Linux-based Kerberos authentication for SSH supports the aes-cbc and
aes-ctr encryption algorithms. An overview of how Nessus interacts with Kerberos is as follows:
l

End-user gives the IP of the KDC

l

nessusd asks sshd if it supports Kerberos authentication

l

sshd says yes

Windows
The Windows credentials menu item has settings to provide Nessus with information such as SMB
account name, password, and domain name. By default, you can specify a username, password, and
domain with which to log in to Windows hosts. Additionally, Nessus supports several different types of
authentication methods for Windows-based systems: CyberArk, Kerberos, LM Hash, NTLM Hash, and
Thycotic Secret Server.
Regarding the authentication methods:
l

The Lanman authentication method was prevalent on Windows NT and early Windows 2000
server deployments. It is retained for backward compatibility.

l

The NTLM authentication method, introduced with Windows NT, provided improved security
over Lanman authentication. The enhanced version, NTLMv2, is cryptographically more secure
than NTLM and is the default authentication method chosen by Nessus when attempting to log
into a Windows server. NTLMv2 can make use of SMB Signing.

l

l

l

l

SMB signing is a cryptographic checksum applied to all SMB traffic to and from a Windows
server. Many system administrators enable this feature on their servers to ensure that remote
users are 100% authenticated and part of a domain. In addition, make sure you enforce a policy
that mandates the use of strong passwords that cannot be easily broken via dictionary attacks
from tools like John the Ripper and L0phtCrack. It is automatically used by Nessus if it is
required by the remote Windows server. Note that there have been many different types of
attacks against Windows security to illicit hashes from computers for re-use in attacking servers.
SMB Signing adds a layer of security to prevent these man-in-the-middle attacks.
The SPNEGO (Simple and Protected Negotiate) protocol provides Single Sign On (SSO) capability
from a Windows client to a variety of protected resources via the users’ Windows login credentials. Nessus supports use of SPNEGO Scans and Policies: Scans 54 of 151 with either
NTLMSSP with LMv2 authentication or Kerberos and RC4 encryption. SPNEGO authentication happens through NTLM or Kerberos authentication; nothing needs to be configured in the Nessus
policy.
If an extended security scheme (such as Kerberos or SPNEGO) is not supported or fails, Nessus
will attempt to log in via NTLMSSP/LMv2 authentication. If that fails, Nessus will then attempt to
log in using NTLM authentication.
Nessus also supports the use of Kerberos authentication in a Windows domain. To configure
this, the IP address of the Kerberos Domain Controller (actually, the IP address of the Windows
Active Directory Server) must be provided.

Server Message Block (SMB) is a file-sharing protocol that allows computers to share information
across the network. Providing this information to Nessus will allow it to find local information from a
remote Windows host. For example, using credentials enables Nessus to determine if important security patches have been applied. It is not necessary to modify other SMB parameters from default settings.
The SMB domain field is optional and Nessus will be able to log on with domain credentials without
this field. The username, password, and optional domain refer to an account that the target machine
is aware of. For example, given a username of joesmith and a password of my4x4mpl3, a Windows
server first looks for this username in the local system’s list of users, and then determines if it is part
of a domain.
Regardless of credentials used, Nessus always attempts to log into a Windows server with the following combinations:
l

Administrator without a password

l

A random username and password to test Guest accounts

l

No username or password to test null sessions

The actual domain name is only required if an account name is different on the domain from that on
the computer. It is entirely possible to have an Administrator account on a Windows server and within
the domain. In this case, to log onto the local server, the username of Administrator is used with the
password of that account. To log onto the domain, the Administrator username would also be used,
but with the domain password and the name of the domain.
When multiple SMB accounts are configured, Nessus will try to log in with the supplied credentials
sequentially. Once Nessus is able to authenticate with a set of credentials, it will check subsequent credentials supplied, but only use them if administrative privileges are granted when previous accounts
provided user access.
Some versions of Windows allow you to create a new account and designate it as an administrator.
These accounts are not always suitable for performing credentialed scans. Tenable recommends that
the original administrative account, named Administrator be used for credentialed scanning to ensure
full access is permitted. On some versions of Windows, this account may be hidden. The real administrator account can be unhidden by running a DOS prompt with administrative privileges and typing
the following command:
C:\> net user administrator /active:yes

If an SMB account is created with limited administrator privileges, Nessus can easily and securely scan
multiple domains. Tenable recommends that network administrators consider creating specific

domain accounts to facilitate testing. Nessus includes a variety of security checks for Windows Vista,
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 that are more accurate if a domain account is provided. Nessus does attempt to
try several checks in most cases if no account is provided.
Note: The Windows Remote Registry service allows remote computers with credentials to access the
registry of the computer being audited. If the service is not running, reading keys and values from the
registry will not be possible, even with full credentials. This service must be started for a Nessus credentialed scan to fully audit a system using credentials.
For more information, see the Tenable, Inc. blog post Dynamic Remote Registry Auditing - Now you
see it, now you don’t!

Credentialed scans on Windows systems require that a full administrator level account be used.
Several bulletins and software updates by Microsoft have made reading the registry to determine software patch level unreliable without administrator privileges, but not all of them. Nessus plugins will
check that the provided credentials have full administrative access to ensure they execute properly.
For example, full administrative access is required to perform direct reading of the file system. This
allows Nessus to attach to a computer and perform direct file analysis to determine the true patch
level of the systems being evaluated.

authentication

Enabled

If this option is disabled, then it is theoretically possible to trick Nessus into attempting to log into a Windows server with domain credentials via the NTLM version 1 protocol. This provides the remote
attacker with the ability to use a hash obtained from Nessus. This
hash can be potentially cracked to reveal a username or password.
It may also be used to directly log into other servers. Force Nessus
to use NTLMv2 by enabling the Only use NTLMv2 setting at scan
time. This prevents a hostile Windows server from using NTLM and
receiving a hash. Because NTLMv1 is an insecure protocol this
option is enabled by default.

Patch Management
Nessus Manager can leverage credentials for the Red Hat Network Satellite, IBM BigFix, Dell KACE 1000,
WSUS, and SCCM patch management systems to perform patch auditing on systems for which credentials may not be available to the Nessus scanner.
Options for these patch management systems can be found under Credentials in their respective
drop-down boxes: Symantec Altiris, IBM BigFix, Red Hat Satellite Server, Microsoft SCCM, Dell KACE
K1000, and Microsoft WSUS.
IT administrators are expected to manage the patch monitoring software and install any agents
required by the patch management system on their systems.

Scanning with Multiple Patch Managers
If you provide multiple sets of credentials to Nessus for patch management tools, Nessus uses all of
them. Available credentials are:
l

Credentials supplied to directly authenticate to the target

l

Dell KACE 1000

l

IBM BigFix

l

Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)

l

Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

l

Red Hat Network Satellite Server

l

Symantec Altiris

If you provide credentials for a host, as well as one or more patch management systems, Nessus compares the findings between all methods and report on conflicts or provide a satisfied finding. Use the
Patch Management Windows Auditing Conflicts plugins to highlight patch data differences between the
host and a patch management system.

Dell KACE K1000
KACE K1000 is available from Dell to manage the distribution of updates and hotfixes for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X systems. Nessus and Tenable.sc have the ability to query KACE K1000 to verify
whether or not patches are installed on systems managed by KACE K1000 and display the patch information through the Nessus or Tenable.sc user interface.

If the credential check sees a system but it is unable to authenticate against the system, it uses
the data obtained from the patch management system to perform the check. If Nessus is able to
connect to the target system, it performs checks on that system and ignores KACE K1000 output.
The data returned to Nessus by KACE K1000 is only as current as the most recent data that the
KACE K1000 has obtained from its managed hosts.

KACE K1000 scanning uses four Nessus plugins.

Plaintext Authentication
Caution: Using plaintext credentials is not recommended. Use encrypted authentication methods when
possible.

If a secure method of performing credentialed checks is not available, users can force Nessus to try to
perform checks over unsecure protocols; use the Plaintext Authentication options.
This menu allows the Nessus scanner to use credentials when testing HTTP, NNTP, FTP, POP2, POP3,
IMAP, IPMI, SNMPv1/v2c, and telnet/rsh/rexec.
By supplying credentials, Nessus may have the ability to do more extensive checks to determine vulnerabilities. HTTP credentials supplied will be used for Basic and Digest authentication only.
Credentials for FTP, IPMI, NNTP, POP2, and POP3 require only a username and password.

HTTP
There are four different types of HTTP Authentication methods: Automatic authentication, Basic/Digest
authentication, HTTP login form, and HTTP cookies import.

HTTP Global Settings
Option

Default

Description

Login method

POST

Specify if the login action is performed via a GET or POST request.

Re-authenticate
delay (seconds)

0

The time delay between authentication attempts. This is useful to
avoid triggering brute force lockout mechanisms.

Follow 30x redirections
(# of levels)

0

If a 30x redirect code is received from a web server, this directs
Nessus to follow the link provided or not.

Invert authenticated regex

Disabled

A regex pattern to look for on the login page, that if found, tells
Nessus authentication was not successful (e.g., Authentication
failed!).

Use authenticated regex on
HTTP headers

Disabled

Rather than search the body of a response, Nessus can search
the HTTP response headers for a given regex pattern to better
determine authentication state.

Disabled

The regex searches are case sensitive by default. This instructs
Nessus to ignore case.

Authentication methods
Automatic authentication
Username and Password Required

Basic/Digest authentication
Username and Password Required

HTTP Login Form
The HTTP login page settings provide control over where authenticated testing of a custom web-based
application begins.

Option

Description

Username

Login user’s name.

Password

Password of the user specified.

Login page

The absolute path to the login page of the application, e.g., /login.html.

Login submission page

The action parameter for the form method. For example, the login form for
<form method="POST" name="auth_form" action="/login.php"> would be /login.php.

Login parameters

Specify the authentication parameters (e.g., loginn=%USER%&password=%PASS%). If the keywords %USER% and %PASS% are
used, they will be substituted with values supplied on the Login configurations
drop-down box. This field can be used to provide more than two parameters if
required (e.g., a group name or some other piece of information is required for
the authentication process).

Check authentication on

The absolute path of a protected web page that requires authentication, to better assist Nessus in determining authentication status, e.g., /admin.html.

Option

Description

page
Regex to verify
successful
authentication

A regex pattern to look for on the login page. Simply receiving a 200 response
code is not always sufficient to determine session state. Nessus can attempt to
match a given string such as Authentication successful!

HTTP cookies import
To facilitate web application testing, Nessus can import HTTP cookies from another piece of software
(e.g., web browser, web proxy, etc.) with the HTTP cookies import settings. A cookie file can be
uploaded so that Nessus uses the cookies when attempting to access a web application. The cookie
file must be in Netscape format.

telnet/rsh/rexec
The telnet/rsh/rexec authentication section is also username and password, but there are additional
Global Settings for this section that can allow you to perform patch audits using any of these three protocols.

SNMPv1/v2c
SNMPv1/v2c configuration allows you to use community strings for authentication to network devices.
Up to 4 SNMP community strings can be configured.

Compliance
Nessus can perform vulnerability scans of network services as well as log in to servers to discover any
missing patches.
However, a lack of vulnerabilities does not mean the servers are configured correctly or are “compliant” with a particular standard.
The advantage of using Nessus to perform vulnerability scans and compliance audits is that all of this
data can be obtained at one time. Knowing how a server is configured, how it is patched and what vulnerabilities are present can help determine measures to mitigate risk.
At a higher level, if this information is aggregated for an entire network or asset class, security and risk
can be analyzed globally. This allows auditors and network managers to spot trends in non-compliant
systems and adjust controls to fix these on a larger scale.
When configuring a scan or policy, you can include one or more compliance checks.

specific scans.
A family with some plugins disabled is blue and displays Mixed to indicate only some plugins are
enabled. Clicking on the plugin family loads the complete list of plugins, and allow for granular selection based on your scanning preferences.
Selecting a specific Plugin Name displays the plugin output that would be seen in a report.
The plugin details include a Synopsis, Description, Solution, Plugin Information, and Risk Inform-

ation.
When a scan or policy is created and saved, it records all of the plugins that are initially selected. When
new plugins are received via a plugin update, they are automatically enabled if the family they are associated with is enabled. If the family has been disabled or partially enabled, new plugins in that family
are also automatically disabled.
Caution: The Denial of Service family contains some plugins that could cause outages on a network if
the Safe Checks option is not enabled, in addition to some useful checks that will not cause any harm.
The Denial of Service family can be used in conjunction with Safe Checks to ensure that any potentially
dangerous plugins are not run. However, it is recommended that the Denial of Service family not be
used on a production network unless scheduled during a maintenance window and with staff ready to
respond to any issues.

Special Use Templates
Note: For more information about performing custom audits with Nessus, see the Custom Auditing
video.

Compliance
Nessus compliance auditing can be configured using one or more of the following Scanner and Agent
templates.
l

Audit Cloud Infrastructure

l

MDM Config Audit

l

Offline Config Audit

l

SCAP and OVAL Auditing

l

Policy Compliance Auditing

Mobile Device
With Nessus Manager, the Nessus Mobile Devices plugin family provides the ability to obtain information from devices registered in a Mobile Device Manager (MDM) and from Active Directory servers that
contain information from Microsoft Exchange Servers.
l

l

l

To query for information, the Nessus scanner must be able to reach the Mobile Device Management servers. You must ensure no screening devices block traffic to these systems from the
Nessus scanner. In addition, Nessus must be given administrative credentials (e.g., domain
administrator) to the Active Directory servers.
To scan for mobile devices, Nessus must be configured with authentication information for the
management server and the mobile plugins. Since Nessus authenticates directly to the management servers, a scan policy does not need to be configured to scan specific hosts.
For ActiveSync scans that access data from Microsoft Exchange servers, Nessus will retrieve
information from phones that have been updated in the last 365 days.

SCAP compliance auditing requires sending an executable to the remote host.
Systems running security software (e.g., McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention), may block or quarantine the executable required for auditing. For those systems, an exception must be made for
the either the host or the executable sent.
When using the SCAP and OVAL Auditing template, you can perform Linux and Windows SCAP

CHECKS to test compliance standards as specified in NIST’s Special Publication 800-126.

Modify a Vulnerability
You can modify a vulnerability to change its severity level or hide it. This allows you to re-prioritize the
severity of results to better account for your organization’s security posture and response plan. When
you modify a vulnerability from the scan results page, the change only applies to that vulnerability
instance for that scan unless you indicate that the change should apply to all future scans. To modify
severity levels for all vulnerabilities, use Plugin Rules.

To modify a vulnerability:
1. In the top navigation bar, click Scans.
The My Scans page appears.

2. Click the scan for which you want to view vulnerabilities.
The scan's results page appears.

3. Do one of the following:
l

Click a specific host to view vulnerabilities found on that host.

l

Compare Scan Results
You can compare two scan results to see differences between them. The comparison shows what is
new since the baseline (i.e., the primary result selected), not a differential of the two results. You cannot compare imported scans or more than two scans.
Comparing scan results helps you see how a given system or network has changed over time. This
information is useful for compliance analysis by showing how vulnerabilities are being remediated, if
systems are patched as new vulnerabilities are found, or how two scans may not be targeting the same
hosts.

1. In the top navigation bar, click Scans.
The My Scans page appears.

2. Click a scan.
3. Click the History tab.
4. In the row of both scan results you want to compare, select the check box.
5. In the upper-right corner, click Diff.
The Choose Primary Result window appears.

6. In the drop-down box, select a scan baseline for the comparison, then click Continue.
The scan result differences are displayed.

About Nessus Plugins
As information about new vulnerabilities are discovered and released into the general public domain,
Tenable, Inc. research staff designs programs to enable Nessus to detect them.
These programs are named plugins, and are written in the Nessus proprietary scripting language,
called Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL).
Plugins contain vulnerability information, a generic set of remediation actions, and the algorithm to
test for the presence of the security issue.
Nessus supports the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and supports both v2 and v3 values
simultaneously. If both CVSS2 and CVSS3 attributes are present, both scores are calculated. However in
determining the Risk Factor attribute, currently the CVSS2 scores take precedence.
Plugins also are utilized to obtain configuration information from authenticated hosts to leverage for
configuration audit purposes against security best practices.
To view plugin information, see a list of newest plugins, view all Nessus plugins, and search for specific
plugins, see the Nessus Plugins home page.

How do I get Nessus Plugins?
By default, plugins are set for automatic updates and Nessus checks for updated components and plugins every 24 hours.

During the Product Registration portion of the Browser Portion of the Nessus install, Nessus downloads all plugins and compiles them into an internal database.
You can also use the nessuscli fetch —register command to manually download plugins. For
more details, see the Command Line section of this guide.
Optionally, during the Registration portion of the Browser Portion of the Nessus install, you can
choose the Custom Settings link and provide a hostname or IP address to a server which hosts your
custom plugin feed.
Tip: Plugins are obtained from port 443 of plugins.nessus.org, plugins-customers.nessus.org, or pluginsus.nessus.org.

How do I update Nessus Plugins?
By default, Nessus checks for updated components and plugins every 24 hours. Additionally, you can
manually update plugins from the Scanner Settings Page in the user interface.
You can also use the nessuscli update --plugins-only command to manually update plugins.
For more details, see the Command Line section of this guide.

Plugin Rules
Plugin Rules allow you to hide or change the severity of any given plugin. In addition, rules can be limited to a specific host or specific time frame. From this page you can view, create, edit, and delete your
rules.
The Plugin Rules option provides a facility to create a set of rules that dictate the behavior of certain
plugins related to any scan performed. A rule can be based on the Host (or all hosts), Plugin ID, an
optional Expiration Date, and manipulation of Severity.
This allows you to re-prioritize the severity of plugin results to better account for your organization’s
security posture and response plan.

Example Plugin Rule
Host: 192.168.0.6
Plugin ID: 79877
Expiration Date: 12/31/2016
Severity: Low
This rule is created for scans performed on IP address 192.168.0.6. Once saved, this Plugin Rule
changes the default severity of plugin ID 79877 (CentOS 7 : rpm (CESA-2014:1976) to a severity of low
until 12/31/2016. After 12/31/2016, the results of plugin ID 79877 will return to its critical severity.

Agents
Agents increase scan flexibility by making it easy to scan assets without needing ongoing host credentials or assets that are offline. Additionally, agents enable large-scale concurrent scanning with
little network impact.
The Agents page displays the Linking Key and a list of linked agents. You can click on a linked agent to
view details about that agent. There are four tabs available on the Agents page: Linked Agents,

Agent Groups, Blackout Windows, and Agent Settings.
Once linked, an agent must be added to a group for use when configuring scans. Linked agents will
automatically download plugins from the manager upon connection. Agents are automatically
unlinked after a period of inactivity.
Note: Agents can take several minutes to download plugins, but it is required before an agent returns
scan results.

Agent Groups
You can use agent groups to organize and manage the agents linked to your Nessus Manager. You can
add an agent to more than one group, and configure scans to use these groups as targets. You can
add an agent to more than one group, and configure scans to use these groups as targets.
Tenable recommends that you size agent groups appropriately, particularly if you are managing scans
in Nessus Manager and then importing the scan data into Tenable.sc. You can size agent groups when
you manage agents in Nessus Manager.
The more agents that you scan and include in a single agent group, the more data that the manager
must process in a single batch. The size of the agent group determines the size of the .nessus file
that must be imported into Tenable.sc. The .nessus file size affects hard drive space and bandwidth.
To manage agent groups, use the following procedures:

Scan and Policy Settings
Scan or Policy Settings are organized into collections of configuration items, specifically Basic, Dis-

covery, Assessment, Report, and Advanced settings. Each of these collections are subdivided into
further sections. For example, the Basic settings include the General, Schedule, Notifications, and

Permissions sections. Additionally, the sections may contain groups of related configuration items.
For example, the Host Discovery section contains the General Settings, Ping Methods, Fragile

Devices, Wake-on-LAN, and Network Type groups.
The following sections of the documentation are organized to reflect the interface. For example, if you
wanted to find information about the General section ( 3 in the previous image) of the Basic settings ( 2
in the previous image) that appears when you select the Settings tab ( 1 in the previous image), you
should locate the table labeled General in the Basic topic. The tables include subheadings to reflect
groups of related configuration items that appear in a particular section.

The following settings exist for each policy, though available configuration items may vary based on
the selected template:

This option enables Nessus to ping remote hosts on multiple ports
to determine if they are alive. When set to On, General Settings
and Ping Methods appear.
Note: To scan VMware guest systems, Ping the remote host must
be set to Off.

General Settings
Use Fast Network Discovery

Disabled

If a host responds to ping, Nessus attempts to avoid false positives,
performing additional tests to verify the response did not come
from a proxy or load balancer. Fast network discovery bypasses
those additional tests.

ARP

Enabled

Ping a host using its hardware address via Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). This only works on a local network.

TCP

Enabled

Ping a host using TCP.

Destination
ports (TCP)

Built-In

Destination ports can be configured to use specific ports for TCP
ping. This specifies the list of ports that are checked via TCP ping.

ICMP

Enabled

Ping a host using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).

Assume ICMP
unreachable
from the gateway means the
host is down

Disabled

Assume ICMP unreachable from the gateway means the host is
down When a ping is sent to a host that is down, its gateway may
return an ICMP unreachable message. When this option is enabled,
when Nessus receives an ICMP Unreachable message, it considers
the targeted host dead. This is to help speed up discovery on some

networks.
Note: Some firewalls and packet filters use this same behavior for
hosts that are up, but connected to a port or protocol that is
filtered. With this option enabled, this leads to the scan considering the host is down when it is indeed up.

Maximum number of retries

2

Specifies the number of attempts to retry pinging the remote host.

UDP

Disabled

Ping a host using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
UDP is a stateless protocol, meaning that communication is not performed with handshake dialogues. UDP-based communication is
not always reliable, and because of the nature of UDP services and
screening devices, they are not always remotely detectable.

Scan Network
Printers

Disabled

When enabled, Nessus scans network printers.

Description
Additionally, you can type a custom range of ports by using a
comma-delimited list of ports or port ranges. For example,

21,23,25,80,110 or 1-1024,8080,9000-9200. If you wanted to
scan all ports excluding port 0, you would type 1-65535.
The custom range specified for a port scan is applied to the protocols you have selected in the Network Port Scanners group of
settings.
If scanning both TCP and UDP, you can specify a split range specific
to each protocol. For example, if you want to scan a different range
of ports for TCP and UDP in the same policy, you would type T:1-

1024,U:300-500.
You can also specify a set of ports to scan for both protocols, as well
as individual ranges for each separate protocol. For example, 1-

1024,T:1024-65535,U:1025.
Local Port Enumerators

This option uses netstat to check for open ports from the local
machine. It relies on the netstat command being available via an SSH
connection to the target. This scan is intended for Linux-based systems and requires authentication credentials.

Description

SYN

Enabled

Use the Nessus SYN scanner to identify open TCP ports on the target
hosts. SYN scans are generally considered to be less intrusive than
TCP scans depending on the security monitoring device, such as a
firewall or Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The scanner sends a SYN
packet to the port, waits for SYN-ACK reply, and determines the port
state based on a reply or lack of reply.

UDP

Disabled

This option engages Nessus built-in UDP scanner to identify open
UDP ports on the targets.
Due to the nature of the protocol, it is generally not possible for a
port scanner to tell the difference between open and filtered UDP
ports. Enabling the UDP port scanner may dramatically increase the
scan time and produce unreliable results. Consider using the netstat
or SNMP port enumeration options instead if possible.

Disabled

This setting manages the combination of argument
values used in the HTTP requests. The default,
without checking this option, is testing one parameter at a time with an attack string, without trying
non-attack variations for additional parameters. For
example, Nessus would attempt

/test.php?arg1=XSS&b=1&c=1, where b and c
allow other values, without testing each combination. This is the quickest method of testing with
the smallest result set generated.
This setting has four options:
l

Test random pairs of parameters: This
form of testing randomly checks a combination of random pairs of parameters. This
is the fastest way to test multiple parameters.

l

Test all pairs of parameters (slow): This
form of testing is slightly slower but more efficient than the one value test. While testing
multiple parameters, it tests an attack string,
variations for a single variable and then use
the first value for all other variables. For
example, Nessus would attempt

/test.php?a=XSS&b=1&c=1&d=1 and then
cycle through the variables so that one is
given the attack string, one is cycled through
all possible values (as discovered during the
mirror process) and any other variables are
given the first value. In this case, Nessus
would never test for /test.php?a-

seeks to create a smaller data set as a tradeoff
for speed, all combinations makes no compromise on time and uses a complete data set
of tests. This testing method may take a long

on the template you select, certain default values may vary.

Setting

Default
Value

Description

General Settings
Enable Safe
Checks

Enabled

When enabled, disables all plugins that may have an adverse effect
on the remote host.

Stop scanning hosts
that become
unresponsive
during the
scan

Disabled

When enabled, Nessus stops scanning if it detects that the host has
become unresponsive. This may occur if users turn off their PCs during a scan, a host has stopped responding after a denial of service
plugin, or a security mechanism (for example, an IDS) has started to
block traffic to a server. Normally, continuing scans on these
machines sends unnecessary traffic across the network and delay the
scan.

Scan IP
addresses in
a random
order

Disabled

By default, Nessus scans a list of IP addresses in sequential order.
When enabled, Nessus scans the list of hosts in a random order
across the entire target IP space. This is typically useful in helping to
distribute the network traffic during large scans.

Slow down
the scan
when network congestion is
detected

Disabled

This enables Nessus to detect when it is sending too many packets
and the network pipe is approaching capacity. If detected, Nessus
throttles the scan to accommodate and alleviate the congestion.
Once the congestion has subsided, Nessus automatically attempts to
use the available space within the network pipe again.

Network
timeout (in
seconds)

5

Specifies the time that Nessus waits for a response from a host
unless otherwise specified within a plugin. If you are scanning over a
slow connection, you may want to set this to a higher number of
seconds.

Max simultaneous
checks per
host

5

Specifies the maximum number of checks a Nessus scanner will perform against a single host at one time.

Credentials
When you configure a scan or policy's Credentials, the Nessus scanner can be granted local access to
scan the target system without requiring an agent. This can facilitate scanning of a very large network
to determine local exposures or compliance violations. As noted, some steps of policy creation may be
optional. Once created, the policy is saved with recommended settings.
Nessus leverages the ability to log into remote Linux hosts via Secure Shell (SSH); and with Windows
hosts, Nessus leverages a variety of Microsoft authentication technologies. Note that Nessus also uses
the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to make version and information queries to routers
and switches.
The scan or policy’s Credentials page allows you to configure the Nessus scanner to use authentication credentials during scanning. Configuring credentials allows Nessus to perform a wider variety
of checks that result in more accurate scan results.
Note: By default, when creating credentialed scans or polices, hosts are identified and marked with a
Tenable Asset Identifier (TAI). This globally unique identifier is written to the host's registry or file system and subsequent scans can retrieve and use the TAI.
This option is enabled (by default) or disabled in the Advanced > General Settings of a scan or policy's
configuration settings: Create unique identifier on hosts scanned using credentials

There are several forms of authentication supported including but not limited to databases, SSH, Windows, network devices, patch management servers, and various plaintext authentication protocols.
In addition to operating system credentials, Nessus supports other forms of local authentication.
The following types of credentials are managed in the Credentials section of the scan or policy:
l

Cloud Services

l

Database, which includes MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL, DB2, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server

l

Host, which includes Windows logins, SSH, and SNMPv3

l

Miscellaneous services, which include VMware, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV), IBM
iSeries, Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS, and directory services (ADSI and X.509)

l

Mobile Device Management

l

Patch Management servers

l

Plaintext authentication mechanisms including FTP, HTTP, POP3, and other services

Credentialed scans can perform any operation that a local user can perform. The level of scanning is
dependent on the privileges granted to the user account. The more privileges the scanner has via the
login account (e.g., root or administrator access), the more thorough the scan results.
Note: Nessus opens several concurrent authenticated connections. Ensure that the host being audited
does not have a strict account lockout policy based on concurrent sessions.

SSH
On Linux systems and supported network devices, Nessus uses Secure Shell (SSH) protocol version 2
based programs (e.g., OpenSSH, Solaris SSH, etc.) for host-based checks.
This mechanism encrypts the data in transit to protect it from being viewed by sniffer programs. Nessus supports five types of authentication methods for use with SSH: username and password, public/private keys, digital certificates, and Kerberos.
Users can select SSH settings from the Credentials menu and enter credentials for scanning Linux systems.
These credentials are used to obtain local information from remote Linux systems for patch auditing
or compliance checks.
Note: Non-privileged users with local access on Linux systems can determine basic security issues,
such as patch levels or entries in the /etc/passwd file. For more comprehensive information, such as
system configuration data or file permissions across the entire system, an account with root privileges
is required

Global Credential Settings
There are four settings for SSH credentials that apply to all SSH Authentication methods.

Option
known_hosts
file

Default
Value
none

Description
If an SSH known_hosts file is available and provided as part of
the Global Credential Settings of the scan policy in the known_

hosts file field, Nessus will only attempt to log into hosts in this
file. This can ensure that the same username and password you
are using to audit your known SSH servers is not used to attempt a
log into a system that may not be under your control.
Preferred port

22

This option can be set to direct Nessus to connect to SSH if it is
running on a port other than 22.

Client version

OpenSSH_
5.0

Specifies which type of SSH client Nessus will impersonate while
scanning.

- 359 -

Option
privilege
(experimental)

Default
Value

Description
Nessus attempts to run the scan with an account with lesser privileges, even if the Elevate privileges with option is enabled. If a
command fails, Nessus will escalate privileges. Plugins 102095 and
102094 report which plugins ran with or without escalated privileges.
Note: Enabling this option may increase scan run time by up to
30%.

Public Key
Public Key Encryption, also referred to as asymmetric key encryption, provides a more secure authentication mechanism by the use of a public and private key pair. In asymmetric cryptography, the public
key is used to encrypt data and the private key is used to decrypt it. The use of public and private keys
is a more secure and flexible method for SSH authentication. Nessus supports both DSA and RSA key
formats.
Like Public Key Encryption, Nessus supports RSA and DSA OpenSSH certificates. Nessus also requires
the user certificate, which is signed by a Certificate Authority (CA), and the user’s private key.
Note: Nessus supports the OpenSSH SSH public key format. Formats from other SSH applications,
including PuTTY and SSH Communications Security, must be converted to OpenSSH public key format.

The most effective credentialed scans are when the supplied credentials have root privileges. Since
many sites do not permit a remote login as root, Nessus can invoke su, sudo, su+sudo, dzdo, .k5login,
or pbrun with a separate password for an account that has been set up to have su or sudo privileges.
In addition, Nessus can escalate privileges on Cisco devices by selecting Cisco ‘enable’ or .k5login for
Kerberos logins.
Note: Nessus supports the blowfish-cbc, aes-cbc, and aes-ctr cipher algorithms. Some commercial variants of SSH do not have support for the blowfish algorithm, possibly for export reasons. It is also possible to configure an SSH server to only accept certain types of encryption. Check your SSH server to
ensure the correct algorithm is supported.

Nessus encrypts all passwords stored in policies. However, the use of SSH keys for authentication
rather than SSH passwords is recommended. This helps ensure that the same username and password
you are using to audit your known SSH servers is not used to attempt a log in to a system that may not
be under your control.

Kerberos
Kerberos, developed by MIT’s Project Athena, is a client/server application that uses a symmetric key
encryption protocol. In symmetric encryption, the key used to encrypt the data is the same as the key
used to decrypt the data. Organizations deploy a KDC (Key Distribution Center) that contains all users
and services that require Kerberos authentication. Users authenticate to Kerberos by requesting a TGT
(Ticket Granting Ticket). Once a user is granted a TGT, it can be used to request service tickets from the
KDC to be able to utilize other Kerberos based services. Kerberos uses the CBC (Cipher Block Chain)
DES encryption protocol to encrypt all communications.
Note: You must already have a Kerberos environment established to use this method of authentication.

The Nessus implementation of Linux-based Kerberos authentication for SSH supports the aes-cbc and
aes-ctr encryption algorithms. An overview of how Nessus interacts with Kerberos is as follows:
l

End-user gives the IP of the KDC

l

nessusd asks sshd if it supports Kerberos authentication

l

sshd says yes

Windows
The Windows credentials menu item has settings to provide Nessus with information such as SMB
account name, password, and domain name. By default, you can specify a username, password, and
domain with which to log in to Windows hosts. Additionally, Nessus supports several different types of
authentication methods for Windows-based systems: CyberArk, Kerberos, LM Hash, NTLM Hash, and
Thycotic Secret Server.
Regarding the authentication methods:
l

The Lanman authentication method was prevalent on Windows NT and early Windows 2000
server deployments. It is retained for backward compatibility.

l

The NTLM authentication method, introduced with Windows NT, provided improved security
over Lanman authentication. The enhanced version, NTLMv2, is cryptographically more secure
than NTLM and is the default authentication method chosen by Nessus when attempting to log
into a Windows server. NTLMv2 can make use of SMB Signing.

l

l

l

l

SMB signing is a cryptographic checksum applied to all SMB traffic to and from a Windows
server. Many system administrators enable this feature on their servers to ensure that remote
users are 100% authenticated and part of a domain. In addition, make sure you enforce a policy
that mandates the use of strong passwords that cannot be easily broken via dictionary attacks
from tools like John the Ripper and L0phtCrack. It is automatically used by Nessus if it is
required by the remote Windows server. Note that there have been many different types of
attacks against Windows security to illicit hashes from computers for re-use in attacking servers.
SMB Signing adds a layer of security to prevent these man-in-the-middle attacks.
The SPNEGO (Simple and Protected Negotiate) protocol provides Single Sign On (SSO) capability
from a Windows client to a variety of protected resources via the users’ Windows login credentials. Nessus supports use of SPNEGO Scans and Policies: Scans 54 of 151 with either
NTLMSSP with LMv2 authentication or Kerberos and RC4 encryption. SPNEGO authentication happens through NTLM or Kerberos authentication; nothing needs to be configured in the Nessus
policy.
If an extended security scheme (such as Kerberos or SPNEGO) is not supported or fails, Nessus
will attempt to log in via NTLMSSP/LMv2 authentication. If that fails, Nessus will then attempt to
log in using NTLM authentication.
Nessus also supports the use of Kerberos authentication in a Windows domain. To configure
this, the IP address of the Kerberos Domain Controller (actually, the IP address of the Windows
Active Directory Server) must be provided.

Server Message Block (SMB) is a file-sharing protocol that allows computers to share information
across the network. Providing this information to Nessus will allow it to find local information from a
remote Windows host. For example, using credentials enables Nessus to determine if important security patches have been applied. It is not necessary to modify other SMB parameters from default settings.
The SMB domain field is optional and Nessus will be able to log on with domain credentials without
this field. The username, password, and optional domain refer to an account that the target machine
is aware of. For example, given a username of joesmith and a password of my4x4mpl3, a Windows
server first looks for this username in the local system’s list of users, and then determines if it is part
of a domain.
Regardless of credentials used, Nessus always attempts to log into a Windows server with the following combinations:
l

Administrator without a password

l

A random username and password to test Guest accounts

l

No username or password to test null sessions

The actual domain name is only required if an account name is different on the domain from that on
the computer. It is entirely possible to have an Administrator account on a Windows server and within
the domain. In this case, to log onto the local server, the username of Administrator is used with the
password of that account. To log onto the domain, the Administrator username would also be used,
but with the domain password and the name of the domain.
When multiple SMB accounts are configured, Nessus will try to log in with the supplied credentials
sequentially. Once Nessus is able to authenticate with a set of credentials, it will check subsequent credentials supplied, but only use them if administrative privileges are granted when previous accounts
provided user access.
Some versions of Windows allow you to create a new account and designate it as an administrator.
These accounts are not always suitable for performing credentialed scans. Tenable recommends that
the original administrative account, named Administrator be used for credentialed scanning to ensure
full access is permitted. On some versions of Windows, this account may be hidden. The real administrator account can be unhidden by running a DOS prompt with administrative privileges and typing
the following command:
C:\> net user administrator /active:yes

If an SMB account is created with limited administrator privileges, Nessus can easily and securely scan
multiple domains. Tenable recommends that network administrators consider creating specific

domain accounts to facilitate testing. Nessus includes a variety of security checks for Windows Vista,
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 that are more accurate if a domain account is provided. Nessus does attempt to
try several checks in most cases if no account is provided.
Note: The Windows Remote Registry service allows remote computers with credentials to access the
registry of the computer being audited. If the service is not running, reading keys and values from the
registry will not be possible, even with full credentials. This service must be started for a Nessus credentialed scan to fully audit a system using credentials.
For more information, see the Tenable, Inc. blog post Dynamic Remote Registry Auditing - Now you
see it, now you don’t!

Credentialed scans on Windows systems require that a full administrator level account be used.
Several bulletins and software updates by Microsoft have made reading the registry to determine software patch level unreliable without administrator privileges, but not all of them. Nessus plugins will
check that the provided credentials have full administrative access to ensure they execute properly.
For example, full administrative access is required to perform direct reading of the file system. This
allows Nessus to attach to a computer and perform direct file analysis to determine the true patch
level of the systems being evaluated.

authentication

Enabled

If this option is disabled, then it is theoretically possible to trick Nessus into attempting to log into a Windows server with domain credentials via the NTLM version 1 protocol. This provides the remote
attacker with the ability to use a hash obtained from Nessus. This
hash can be potentially cracked to reveal a username or password.
It may also be used to directly log into other servers. Force Nessus
to use NTLMv2 by enabling the Only use NTLMv2 setting at scan
time. This prevents a hostile Windows server from using NTLM and
receiving a hash. Because NTLMv1 is an insecure protocol this
option is enabled by default.

Patch Management
Nessus Manager can leverage credentials for the Red Hat Network Satellite, IBM BigFix, Dell KACE 1000,
WSUS, and SCCM patch management systems to perform patch auditing on systems for which credentials may not be available to the Nessus scanner.
Options for these patch management systems can be found under Credentials in their respective
drop-down boxes: Symantec Altiris, IBM BigFix, Red Hat Satellite Server, Microsoft SCCM, Dell KACE
K1000, and Microsoft WSUS.
IT administrators are expected to manage the patch monitoring software and install any agents
required by the patch management system on their systems.

Scanning with Multiple Patch Managers
If you provide multiple sets of credentials to Nessus for patch management tools, Nessus uses all of
them. Available credentials are:
l

Credentials supplied to directly authenticate to the target

l

Dell KACE 1000

l

IBM BigFix

l

Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)

l

Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)

l

Red Hat Network Satellite Server

l

Symantec Altiris

If you provide credentials for a host, as well as one or more patch management systems, Nessus compares the findings between all methods and report on conflicts or provide a satisfied finding. Use the
Patch Management Windows Auditing Conflicts plugins to highlight patch data differences between the
host and a patch management system.

Dell KACE K1000
KACE K1000 is available from Dell to manage the distribution of updates and hotfixes for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X systems. Nessus and Tenable.sc have the ability to query KACE K1000 to verify
whether or not patches are installed on systems managed by KACE K1000 and display the patch information through the Nessus or Tenable.sc user interface.

If the credential check sees a system but it is unable to authenticate against the system, it uses
the data obtained from the patch management system to perform the check. If Nessus is able to
connect to the target system, it performs checks on that system and ignores KACE K1000 output.
The data returned to Nessus by KACE K1000 is only as current as the most recent data that the
KACE K1000 has obtained from its managed hosts.

KACE K1000 scanning uses four Nessus plugins.
l

kace_k1000_get_computer_info.nbin (Plugin ID 76867)

l

kace_k1000_get_missing_updates.nbin (Plugin ID 76868)

Plaintext Authentication
Caution: Using plaintext credentials is not recommended. Use encrypted authentication methods when
possible.

If a secure method of performing credentialed checks is not available, users can force Nessus to try to
perform checks over unsecure protocols; use the Plaintext Authentication options.
This menu allows the Nessus scanner to use credentials when testing HTTP, NNTP, FTP, POP2, POP3,
IMAP, IPMI, SNMPv1/v2c, and telnet/rsh/rexec.
By supplying credentials, Nessus may have the ability to do more extensive checks to determine vulnerabilities. HTTP credentials supplied will be used for Basic and Digest authentication only.
Credentials for FTP, IPMI, NNTP, POP2, and POP3 require only a username and password.

HTTP
There are four different types of HTTP Authentication methods: Automatic authentication, Basic/Digest
authentication, HTTP login form, and HTTP cookies import.

HTTP Global Settings
Option

Default

Description

Login method

POST

Specify if the login action is performed via a GET or POST request.

Re-authenticate
delay (seconds)

0

The time delay between authentication attempts. This is useful to
avoid triggering brute force lockout mechanisms.

Follow 30x redirections
(# of levels)

0

If a 30x redirect code is received from a web server, this directs
Nessus to follow the link provided or not.

Invert authenticated regex

Disabled

A regex pattern to look for on the login page, that if found, tells
Nessus authentication was not successful (e.g., Authentication
failed!).

Use authenticated regex on
HTTP headers

Disabled

Rather than search the body of a response, Nessus can search
the HTTP response headers for a given regex pattern to better
determine authentication state.

The regex searches are case sensitive by default. This instructs
Nessus to ignore case.

Authentication methods
Automatic authentication
Username and Password Required

Basic/Digest authentication
Username and Password Required

HTTP Login Form
The HTTP login page settings provide control over where authenticated testing of a custom web-based
application begins.

Option

Description

Username

Login user’s name.

Password

Password of the user specified.

Login page

The absolute path to the login page of the application, e.g., /login.html.

Login submission page

The action parameter for the form method. For example, the login form for
<form method="POST" name="auth_form" action="/login.php"> would be /login.php.

Login parameters

Specify the authentication parameters (e.g., loginn=%USER%&password=%PASS%). If the keywords %USER% and %PASS% are
used, they will be substituted with values supplied on the Login configurations
drop-down box. This field can be used to provide more than two parameters if
required (e.g., a group name or some other piece of information is required for
the authentication process).

Check authentication on

The absolute path of a protected web page that requires authentication, to better assist Nessus in determining authentication status, e.g., /admin.html.

Option

Description

page
Regex to verify
successful
authentication

A regex pattern to look for on the login page. Simply receiving a 200 response
code is not always sufficient to determine session state. Nessus can attempt to
match a given string such as Authentication successful!

HTTP cookies import
To facilitate web application testing, Nessus can import HTTP cookies from another piece of software
(e.g., web browser, web proxy, etc.) with the HTTP cookies import settings. A cookie file can be
uploaded so that Nessus uses the cookies when attempting to access a web application. The cookie
file must be in Netscape format.

telnet/rsh/rexec
The telnet/rsh/rexec authentication section is also username and password, but there are additional
Global Settings for this section that can allow you to perform patch audits using any of these three protocols.

SNMPv1/v2c
SNMPv1/v2c configuration allows you to use community strings for authentication to network devices.
Up to 4 SNMP community strings can be configured.

Compliance
Nessus can perform vulnerability scans of network services as well as log in to servers to discover any
missing patches.
However, a lack of vulnerabilities does not mean the servers are configured correctly or are “compliant” with a particular standard.
The advantage of using Nessus to perform vulnerability scans and compliance audits is that all of this
data can be obtained at one time. Knowing how a server is configured, how it is patched and what vulnerabilities are present can help determine measures to mitigate risk.
At a higher level, if this information is aggregated for an entire network or asset class, security and risk
can be analyzed globally. This allows auditors and network managers to spot trends in non-compliant
systems and adjust controls to fix these on a larger scale.
When configuring a scan or policy, you can include one or more compliance checks.

Plugins
The Advanced Scan templates include Plugin options.

Plugins options enables you to select security checks by Plugin Family or individual plugins checks.
Clicking on the Plugin Family allows you to enable (green) or disable (gray) the entire family. Selecting a family displays the list of its plugins. Individual plugins can be enabled or disabled to create very
specific scans.
A family with some plugins disabled is blue and displays Mixed to indicate only some plugins are
enabled. Clicking on the plugin family loads the complete list of plugins, and allow for granular selection based on your scanning preferences.
Selecting a specific Plugin Name displays the plugin output that would be seen in a report.
The plugin details include a Synopsis, Description, Solution, Plugin Information, and Risk Inform-

ation.
When a scan or policy is created and saved, it records all of the plugins that are initially selected. When
new plugins are received via a plugin update, they are automatically enabled if the family they are associated with is enabled. If the family has been disabled or partially enabled, new plugins in that family
are also automatically disabled.
Caution: The Denial of Service family contains some plugins that could cause outages on a network if
the Safe Checks option is not enabled, in addition to some useful checks that will not cause any harm.
The Denial of Service family can be used in conjunction with Safe Checks to ensure that any potentially
dangerous plugins are not run. However, it is recommended that the Denial of Service family not be
used on a production network unless scheduled during a maintenance window and with staff ready to
respond to any issues.

Compliance
Nessus compliance auditing can be configured using one or more of the following Scanner and Agent
templates.
l

Audit Cloud Infrastructure

l

MDM Config Audit

l

Offline Config Audit

l

SCAP and OVAL Auditing

l

Policy Compliance Auditing

Mobile Device
With Nessus Manager, the Nessus Mobile Devices plugin family provides the ability to obtain information from devices registered in a Mobile Device Manager (MDM) and from Active Directory servers that
contain information from Microsoft Exchange Servers.
l

l

l

To query for information, the Nessus scanner must be able to reach the Mobile Device Management servers. You must ensure no screening devices block traffic to these systems from the
Nessus scanner. In addition, Nessus must be given administrative credentials (e.g., domain
administrator) to the Active Directory servers.
To scan for mobile devices, Nessus must be configured with authentication information for the
management server and the mobile plugins. Since Nessus authenticates directly to the management servers, a scan policy does not need to be configured to scan specific hosts.
For ActiveSync scans that access data from Microsoft Exchange servers, Nessus will retrieve
information from phones that have been updated in the last 365 days.

Payment Card Industry (PCI)
Tenable offers two Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) templates: one for

SCAP and OVAL
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Security Content Automation Protocol
(SCAP) is a set of policies for managing vulnerabilities and policy compliance in government agencies.
It relies on multiple open standards and policies, including OVAL, CVE, CVSS, CPE, and FDCC policies.

SCAP compliance auditing requires sending an executable to the remote host.
Systems running security software (e.g., McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention), may block or quarantine the executable required for auditing. For those systems, an exception must be made for
the either the host or the executable sent.
When using the SCAP and OVAL Auditing template, you can perform Linux and Windows SCAP

CHECKS to test compliance standards as specified in NIST’s Special Publication 800-126.

Unofficial PCI ASV Validation Scan
Approved Scanning Vendors (ASVs) are organizations that validate adherence to certain Data Security
Standards (DSS) requirements by performing vulnerability scans of internet facing environments of
merchants and service providers.
Tenable, Inc. is a Payment Card Industry (PCI) ASV, and is certified to validate vulnerability scans of
internet-facing systems for adherence to certain aspects of the PCI DSS and Tenable.io is a validated
ASV solution.
Nessus Professional and Nessus Manager features two PCI related scan templates: Internal
PCI Network Scan and Unofficial PCI Quarterly External Scan.

Internal PCI Network Scan
This template creates scans that may be used to satisfy internal (PCI DSS 11.2.1) scanning requirements
for ongoing vulnerability management programs that satisfy PCI compliance requirements. These
scans may be used for ongoing vulnerability management and to perform rescans until passing or
clean results are achieved. Credentials can optionally be provided to enumerate missing patches and
cilent-side vulnerabilities.
Note: while the PCI DSS requires you to provide evidence of passing or "clean" scans on at least a
quarterly basis, you are also required to perform scans after any significant changes to your network
(PCI DSS 11.2.3).

Unofficial PCI Quarterly External Scan
The Unofficial PCI Quarterly External Scan template creates a scan that simulates an external scan
(PCI DSS 11.2.2) performed by Tenable.io to meet PCI DSS quarterly scanning requirements. Although
the results may not be submitted for validation, they may be used to see what "official" Tenable.io
results might look like. Users that have external PCI scanning requirements should use this template in
Tenable.io, which allows scanning unlimited times before submitting results to Tenable, Inc. for validation (Tenable.io is a validated ASV solution).
For more information on performing and submitting an official PCI Quarterly External Scan, see the

Tenable.io User Guide.

You can compare two scan results to see differences between them. The comparison shows what is
new since the baseline (i.e., the primary result selected), not a differential of the two results. You cannot compare imported scans or more than two scans.
Comparing scan results helps you see how a given system or network has changed over time. This
information is useful for compliance analysis by showing how vulnerabilities are being remediated, if
systems are patched as new vulnerabilities are found, or how two scans may not be targeting the same
hosts.

About Nessus Plugins
As information about new vulnerabilities are discovered and released into the general public domain,
Tenable, Inc. research staff designs programs to enable Nessus to detect them.
These programs are named plugins, and are written in the Nessus proprietary scripting language,
called Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL).
Plugins contain vulnerability information, a generic set of remediation actions, and the algorithm to
test for the presence of the security issue.
Nessus supports the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and supports both v2 and v3 values
simultaneously. If both CVSS2 and CVSS3 attributes are present, both scores are calculated. However in
determining the Risk Factor attribute, currently the CVSS2 scores take precedence.
Plugins also are utilized to obtain configuration information from authenticated hosts to leverage for
configuration audit purposes against security best practices.
To view plugin information, see a list of newest plugins, view all Nessus plugins, and search for specific
plugins, see the Nessus Plugins home page.

During the Product Registration portion of the Browser Portion of the Nessus install, Nessus downloads all plugins and compiles them into an internal database.
You can also use the nessuscli fetch —register command to manually download plugins. For
more details, see the Command Line section of this guide.
Optionally, during the Registration portion of the Browser Portion of the Nessus install, you can
choose the Custom Settings link and provide a hostname or IP address to a server which hosts your
custom plugin feed.
Tip: Plugins are obtained from port 443 of plugins.nessus.org, plugins-customers.nessus.org, or pluginsus.nessus.org.

How do I update Nessus Plugins?
By default, Nessus checks for updated components and plugins every 24 hours. Additionally, you can
manually update plugins from the Scanner Settings Page in the user interface.
You can also use the nessuscli update --plugins-only command to manually update plugins.
For more details, see the Command Line section of this guide.

Plugin Rules
Plugin Rules allow you to hide or change the severity of any given plugin. In addition, rules can be limited to a specific host or specific time frame. From this page you can view, create, edit, and delete your
rules.
The Plugin Rules option provides a facility to create a set of rules that dictate the behavior of certain
plugins related to any scan performed. A rule can be based on the Host (or all hosts), Plugin ID, an
optional Expiration Date, and manipulation of Severity.
This allows you to re-prioritize the severity of plugin results to better account for your organization’s
security posture and response plan.

Example Plugin Rule
Host: 192.168.0.6
Plugin ID: 79877
Expiration Date: 12/31/2016
Severity: Low
This rule is created for scans performed on IP address 192.168.0.6. Once saved, this Plugin Rule
changes the default severity of plugin ID 79877 (CentOS 7 : rpm (CESA-2014:1976) to a severity of low
until 12/31/2016. After 12/31/2016, the results of plugin ID 79877 will return to its critical severity.

Agents
Agents increase scan flexibility by making it easy to scan assets without needing ongoing host credentials or assets that are offline. Additionally, agents enable large-scale concurrent scanning with
little network impact.
The Agents page displays the Linking Key and a list of linked agents. You can click on a linked agent to
view details about that agent. There are four tabs available on the Agents page: Linked Agents,

Agent Groups, Blackout Windows, and Agent Settings.
Once linked, an agent must be added to a group for use when configuring scans. Linked agents will
automatically download plugins from the manager upon connection. Agents are automatically
unlinked after a period of inactivity.
Note: Agents can take several minutes to download plugins, but it is required before an agent returns
scan results.

Agent Groups
You can use agent groups to organize and manage the agents linked to your Nessus Manager. You can
add an agent to more than one group, and configure scans to use these groups as targets. You can
add an agent to more than one group, and configure scans to use these groups as targets.
Tenable recommends that you size agent groups appropriately, particularly if you are managing scans
in Nessus Manager and then importing the scan data into Tenable.sc. You can size agent groups when
you manage agents in Nessus Manager.
The more agents that you scan and include in a single agent group, the more data that the manager
must process in a single batch. The size of the agent group determines the size of the .nessus file
that must be imported into Tenable.sc. The .nessus file size affects hard drive space and bandwidth.
To manage agent groups, use the following procedures:

Agent Host System Utilization
Note: Performance varies by environment and you may or may not see similar results.

Generally, a Nessus Agent uses 40 MB of RAM (all pageable). A Nessus Agent uses almost no CPU while
idle, but is designed to use up to 100% of CPU when available during jobs.
To measure network utilization when uploading results, Tenable monitored Agent uploads intoTenable.io over a 7 day period. Of over 36,000 uploads observed:
l

The average size was 1.6 MB.

l

The largest size was 37 MB.

l

90% of uploads were 2.2 MB or less.

l

99% of uploads were 5 MB or less.

l

Nessus Agent consumes 40 MB of RAM when dormant.

l

The Watchdog service consumes 3 MB.

l

Plugins consume approximately 300 MB of disk space (varies based on operating system).

l

Scan results from Nessus Agents to Nessus Manager and Tenable.io range between 2-3 MB.

l

Check-in frequency starts at 30 seconds and is adjusted by Nessus Manager orTenable.io based
on the management system load (number of agents).

Nessus-Service
If necessary, whenever possible, Nessus services should be started and stopped using Nessus Service
controls in the operating system’s interface.
However, there are many nessus-service functions that can be performed through a command line
interface.
Unless otherwise specified, the nessusd command can be used interchangeably with nessus-ser-

vice server commands.
The # killall nessusd command is used to stop all Nessus services and in-process scans.
Note: All commands must be run by a user with administrative privileges.

Nessusd Commands
Option

Description

-c <config-file>

When starting the nessusd server, this option is used to specify the server-side nessusd configuration file to use. It allows for the use of an alternate configuration file
instead of the standard db.

-a
<address>

When starting the nessusd server, this option is used to tell the server to only listen
to connections on the address <address> that is an IP, not a machine name. This
option is useful if you are running nessusd on a gateway and if you do not want
people on the outside to connect to your nessusd.

-S <ip
[,ip2,…]>

When starting the nessusd server, force the source IP of the connections established
by Nessus during scanning to <ip>. This option is only useful if you have a multihomed machine with multiple public IP addresses that you would like to use
instead of the default one. For this setup to work, the host running nessusd must
have multiple NICs with these IP addresses set.

-D

When starting the nessusd server, this option forces the server to run in the background (daemon mode).

-v

Display the version number and exit.

-l

Display a list of those third-party software licenses.

-h

Show a summary of the commands and exit.

--ipv4only

Only listen on IPv4 socket.

--ipv6only

Only listen on IPv6 socket.

-q

Operate in "quiet" mode, suppressing all messages to stdout.

-R

Force a re-processing of the plugins.

-t

Check the time stamp of each plugin when starting up to only compile newly
updated plugins.

-K

Set a master password for the scanner.
If a master password is set, Nessus encrypts all policies and credentials contained in
the policy. When a password is set, the Nessus UI prompts you for the password.

Nessus Credentialed Checks
In addition to remote scanning, Nessus can be used to scan for local exposures. For information about
configuring credentialed checks, see Credentialed Checks on Windows and Credentialed Checks

on Linux.

Purpose
External network vulnerability scanning is useful to obtain a snapshot in time of the network services
offered and the vulnerabilities they may contain. However, it is only an external perspective. It is
important to determine what local services are running and to identify security exposures from local
attacks or configuration settings that could expose the system to external attacks that may not be
detected from an external scan.
In a typical network vulnerability assessment, a remote scan is performed against the external points
of presence and an on-site scan is performed from within the network. Neither of these scans can
determine local exposures on the target system. Some of the information gained relies on the banner
information displayed, which may be inconclusive or incorrect. By using secured credentials, the Nessus scanner can be granted local access to scan the target system without requiring an agent. This can
facilitate scanning of a very large network to determine local exposures or compliance violations.
The most common security problem in an organization is that security patches are not applied in a
timely manner. A Nessus credentialed scan can quickly determine which systems are out of date on
patch installation. This is especially important when a new vulnerability is made public and executive
management wants a quick answer regarding the impact to the organization.
Another major concern for organizations is to determine compliance with site policy, industry standards (such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks) or legislation (such as Sarbanes-Oxley,
Gramm-Leach-Bliley or HIPAA). Organizations that accept credit card information must demonstrate
compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards. There have been quite a few well-publicized cases where the credit card information for millions of customers was breached. This represents a significant financial loss to the banks responsible for covering the payments and heavy fines
or loss of credit card acceptance capabilities by the breached merchant or processor.

Access Level
Credentialed scans can perform any operation that a local user can perform. The level of scanning is
dependent on the privileges granted to the user account that Nessus is configured to use.

Non-privileged users with local access on Linux systems can determine basic security issues, such as
patch levels or entries in the /etc/passwd file. For more comprehensive information, such as system
configuration data or file permissions across the entire system, an account with “root” privileges is
required.
Credentialed scans on Windows systems require that an administrator level account be used. Several
bulletins and software updates by Microsoft have made reading the registry to determine software
patch level unreliable without administrator privileges. Administrative access is required to perform
direct reading of the file system. This allows Nessus to attach to a computer and perform direct file
analysis to determine the true patch level of the systems being evaluated. On Windows XP Pro, this file
access will only work with a local administrator account if the “Network access: Sharing and security
model for local accounts” policy is changed to “Classic – local users authenticate as themselves”.

Detecting When Credentials Fail
If you are using Nessus to perform credentialed audits of Linux or Windows systems, analyzing the results to determine if you had the correct passwords and SSH keys can be difficult. You can detect if your
credentials are not working using plugin 21745.
This plugin detects if either SSH or Windows credentials did not allow the scan to log into the remote
host. When a login is successful, this plugin does not produce a result.

Credentialed Checks on Windows
The process described in this section enables you to perform local security checks on Windows systems. Only Domain Administrator accounts can be used to scan Domain Controllers.

Configure a Domain Account for Authenticated Scanning
To create a domain account for remote host-based auditing of a Windows server, the server must first
be Windows Server 2008, Server 2008 R2*, Server 2012, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016, Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 and must be part of a domain.

Create a Security Group called Nessus Local Access
1. Log in to a Domain Controller and open Active Directory Users and Computers.
2. To create a security group, select Action > New > Group.
3. Name the group Nessus Local Access. Set Scope to Global and Type to Security.
4. Add the account you will use to perform Nessus Windows Authenticated Scans to the Nessus
Local Access group.

Create Group Policy called Local Admin GPO

1. In Group policy management console, right-click the domain or the OU and select Link an Existing GPO.
2. Select the Nessus Scan GPO.

Configure Windows 2008, Vista, 7, 8, and 10
1. Under Windows Firewall > Windows Firewall Settings, enable File and Printer Sharing.
2. Using the gpedit.msc tool (via the Run prompt), invoke the Group Policy Object Editor. Navigate to Local Computer Policy > Administrative Templates > Network > Network Con-

nections > Windows Firewall > Standard Profile > Windows Firewall : Allow inbound file
and printer exception, and enable it.
3. While in the Group Policy Object Editor, navigate to Local Computer Policy > Administrative
Templates > Network > Network Connections > Prohibit use of Internet connection firewall on your DNS domain and ensure it is set to either Disabled or Not Configured.
4. The Remote Registry service must be enabled (it is disabled by default). It can be enabled
manually for continuing audits, either by an administrator or by Nessus. Using plugin IDs 42897
and 42898, Nessus can enable the service just for the duration of the scan.
Note: Enabling this option configures Nessus to attempt to start the remote registry service prior to
starting the scan.
The Windows credentials provided in the Nessus scan policy must have administrative permissions to
start the Remote Registry service on the host being scanned.

Caution: While not recommended, Windows User Account Control (UAC) can be disabled.
Tip: To turn off UAC completely, open the Control Panel, select User Accounts and then set Turn User
Account Control to off. Alternatively, you can add a new registry key named LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy and set its value to 1.
This key must be created in the registry at the following location: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\system\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy.
For more information on this registry setting, consult the MSDN 766945 KB. In Windows 7 and 8, if UAC is
disabled, then EnableLUA must be set to 0 in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System as well.

Prerequisites
A very common mistake is to create a local account that does not have enough privileges to log on
remotely and do anything useful. By default, Windows will assign new local accounts Guest privileges if
they are logged into remotely. This prevents remote vulnerability audits from succeeding. Another common mistake is to increase the amount of access that the Guest users obtain. This reduces the security
of your Windows server.

Enable Windows Logins for Local and Remote Audits
The most important aspect about Windows credentials is that the account used to perform the checks
should have privileges to access all required files and registry entries, which in many cases means
administrative privileges. If Nessus is not provided the credentials for an administrative account, at
best it can be used to perform registry checks for the patches. While this is still a valid method to
determine if a patch is installed, it is incompatible with some third party patch management tools that
may neglect to set the key in the policy. If Nessus has administrative privileges, then it will actually
check the version of the dynamic-link library (.dll) on the remote host, which is considerably more
accurate.

Configure a Local Account
To configure a stand-alone Windows server with credentials to be used that is not part of a domain,
simply create a unique account as the administrator.
Make sure that the configuration of this account is not set with a typical default of Guest only: local

users authenticate as guest. Instead, switch this to Classic: local users authenticate as themselves.

Configuring a Domain Account for Local Audits
To create a domain account for remote host-based auditing of a Windows server, the server must first
be Windows 2000 Server, Windows XP Pro, or Windows 2008 Server and be part of a domain.
To configure the server to allow logins from a domain account, use the Classic security model. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Start menu and select Run.
2. Enter gpedit.msc and select OK.
3. Select Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies >
Security Options.
4. In the list, select Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts.
The Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts window appears.

5. In the Local Security Setting section, in the drop-down box, select Classic - local users authen-

ticate as themselves.
6. Click OK.
This will cause users local to the domain to authenticate as themselves, even though they are not physically local on the particular server. Without doing this, all remote users, even real users in the domain,
will authenticate as a guest and will likely not have enough credentials to perform a remote audit.

Configuring Windows XP
When performing authenticated scans against Windows XP systems, there are several configuration
options that must be enabled:
l

The WMI service must be enabled on the target.

l

The Remote Registry service must be enabled on the target.

l

File & Printer Sharing must be enabled in the target’s network configuration.

l

Ports 139 and 445 must be open between the Nessus scanner and the target.

l

An SMB account must be used that has local administrator rights on the target.

You may be required to change the Windows local security policies or they could block access or inherent permissions. A common policy that will affect credentialed scans is found under:

Administrative Tools > Local Security Policy > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security
Options > Network access: Sharing and security model for local accounts.
If this local security policy is set to something other than Classic - local users authenticate as

themselves, a compliance scan will not run successfully.

Configuring Windows Server, Vista, 7, 8, and 10.
When performing authenticated scans against Windows systems, there are several configuration

Windows User Account Control (UAC) must be disabled, or a specific registry setting must be
changed to allow Nessus audits. To turn off UAC completely, open the Control Panel, select User

Accounts and then set Turn User Account Control to Off. Alternatively, you can add a new
registry DWORD named LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy and set its value to “1”. This key must
be created in the registry at the following location: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Mi-

Credentialed Checks on Linux
The process described in this section enables you to perform local security checks on Linux based systems. The SSH daemon used in this example is OpenSSH. If you have a commercial variant of SSH, your
procedure may be slightly different.
You can enable local security checks using an SSH private/public key pair or user credentials and sudo
or su access.

Prerequisites
Configuration Requirements for SSH
Nessus supports the blowfish-cbc, aesXXX-cbc (aes128, aes192 and aes256), 3des-cbc and aes-ctr
algorithms.
Some commercial variants of SSH do not have support for the blowfish cipher, possibly for export reasons. It is also possible to configure an SSH server to only accept certain types of encryption. Check that
your SSH server supports the correct algorithm.

User Privileges
For maximum effectiveness, the SSH user must have the ability to run any command on the system. On
Linux systems, this is known as root privileges. While it is possible to run some checks (such as patch
levels) with non-privileged access, full compliance checks that audit system configuration and file permissions require root access. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that SSH keys be used
instead of credentials when possible.

Configuration Requirements for Kerberos
If Kerberos is used, sshd must be configured with Kerberos support to verify the ticket with the KDC.
Reverse DNS lookups must be properly configured for this to work. The Kerberos interaction method
must be gssapi-with-mic.

Enable SSH Local Security Checks
This section is intended to provide a high-level procedure for enabling SSH between the systems
involved in the Nessus credential checks. It is not intended to be an in-depth tutorial on SSH. It is
assumed the reader has the prerequisite knowledge of Linux system commands.

Generating SSH Public and Private Keys
The first step is to generate a private/public key pair for the Nessus scanner to use. This key pair can
be generated from any of your Linux systems, using any user account. However, it is important that the
keys be owned by the defined Nessus user.
To generate the key pair, use ssh-keygen and save the key in a safe place. In the following example
the keys are generated on a Red Hat ES 3 installation.
# ssh-keygen -t dsa
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/test/.ssh/id_dsa):
/home/test/Nessus/ssh_key
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in
/home/test/Nessus/ssh_key.
Your public key has been saved in
/home/test/Nessus/ssh_key.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
06:4a:fd:76:ee:0f:d4:e6:4b:74:84:9a:99:e6:12:ea
#

Do not transfer the private key to any system other than the one running the Nessus server. When

ssh-keygen asks you for a passphrase, enter a strong passphrase or press the Return key twice (i.e.,
do not set any passphrase). If a passphrase is specified, it must be specified in Policies > Credentials
> SSH settings in order for Nessus to use key-based authentication.
Nessus Windows users may wish to copy both keys to the main Nessus application directory on the system running Nessus (C:\Program Files\Tenable\Nessus by default), and then copy the public
key to the target systems as needed. This makes it easier to manage the public and private key files.

Creating a User Account and Setting up the SSH Key

- 489 -

On every target system to be scanned using local security checks, create a new user account dedicated
to Nessus. This user account must have exactly the same name on all systems. For this document, we
will call the user nessus, but you can use any name.
Once the account is created for the user, make sure that the account has no valid password set. On
Linux systems, new user accounts are locked by default, unless an initial password was explicitly set. If
you are using an account where a password had been set, use the passwd –l command to lock the
account.
You must also create the directory under this new account’s home directory to hold the public key. For
this exercise, the directory will be /home/nessus/.ssh. An example for Linux systems is provided
below:
# passwd –l nessus
# cd /home/nessus
# mkdir .ssh
#

For Solaris 10 systems, Sun has enhanced the passwd(1) command to distinguish between locked
and non-login accounts. This is to ensure that a user account that has been locked may not be used to
execute commands (e.g., cron jobs). Non-login accounts are used only to execute commands and do
not support an interactive login session. These accounts have the “NP” token in the password field of

/etc/shadow. To set a non-login account and create the SSH public key directory in Solaris 10, run
the following commands:
# passwd –N nessus
# grep nessus /etc/shadow
nessus:NP:13579::::::
# cd /export/home/nessus
# mkdir .ssh
#

Now that the user account is created, you must transfer the key to the system, place it in the appropriate directory and set the correct permissions.

Example
From the system containing the keys, secure copy the public key to system that will be scanned for
host checks as shown below. 192.1.1.44 is an example remote system that will be tested with the hostbased checks.

- 490 -

# scp ssh_key.pub root@192.1.1.44:/home/nessus/.ssh/authorized_keys
#

You can also copy the file from the system on which Nessus is installed using the secure ftp command,

sftp. Note that the file on the target system must be named authorized_keys.

Return to the System Housing the Public Key
Set the permissions on both the /home/nessus/.ssh directory, as well as the authorized_keys
file.
# chown -R nessus:nessus ~nessus/.ssh/
# chmod 0600 ~nessus/.ssh/authorized_keys
# chmod 0700 ~nessus/.ssh/
#

Repeat this process on all systems that will be tested for SSH checks (starting at “Creating a User
Account and Setting up the SSH Key” above).
Test to make sure that the accounts and networks are configured correctly. Using the simple Linux
command id, from the Nessus scanner, run the following command:
# ssh -i /home/test/nessus/ssh_key nessus@192.1.1.44 id
uid=252(nessus) gid=250(tns) groups=250(tns)
#

If it successfully returns information about the Nessus user, the key exchange was successful.

Nessus 6.7 and later has the ability to run as a non-privileged user.

Limitations
l

l

When scanning localhost, Nessus plugins assume that they are running as root. Therefore, certain types of scans may fail. For example, because Nessus is now running as a non-privileged
user, file content Compliance Audits may fail or return erroneous results since the plugins are
not able to access all directories.

nessuscli does not have a --no-root mode. Running commands with nessuscli as root
could potentially create files in the Nessus install directory owned by root, which can prohibit
Nessus from accessing them successfully. Use care when running nessuscli, and potentially fix
permissions with chown after using it.

Run Nessus on Mac OS X as a Non-Privileged User
Limitations
l

l

l

For use with Nessus 6.7 or later.
When scanning localhost, Nessus plugins assume that they are running as root. Therefore, certain types of scans may fail. For example, because Nessus is now running as a non-privileged
user, file content Compliance Audits may fail or return erroneous results since the plugins are
not able to access all directories.

nessuscli does not have a --no-root mode. Running commands with nessuscli as root
could potentially create files in the Nessus install directory owned by root, which could cause
Nessus to be unable to access them appropriately. Use care when running nessuscli, and
potentially fix permissions with chown after using it.

Steps
1. If you have not already done so, Install Nessus on MacOSX.
2. Since the Nessus service is running as root, it needs to be unloaded.
Use the following command to unload the Nessus service:
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.tenablesecurity.nessusd.plist

3. On the Mac, in System Preferences > Users & Groups, create a new Group.
4. Next, in System Preferences > Users & Groups, create the new Standard User. This user will
be configured to run as the Nessus non-privileged account.

6. Remove 'world' permissions on Nessus binaries in the /sbin directory.
sudo chmod 750 /Library/Nessus/run/sbin/*

7. Change ownership of /Library/Nessus/run directory to the non-root (Standard) user you created in Step 2.
sudo chown -R nonprivuser:nonprivuser /Library/Nessus/run

8. Give that user read/write permissions to the /dev/bpf* devices. A simple way to do this is to
install Wireshark, which creates a group called access_bpf, as well as a corresponding launch
daemon to set appropriate permissions on /dev/bpf* at startup. In this case, you can simply
assign the nonpriv user to be in the access_bpf group. Otherwise, you will need to create a
launch daemon giving the "nonpriv" user, or a group that it is a part of, read/write permissions
to all /dev/bpf*.

9. For Step 8. changes to take effect, reboot your system.
10. Using a text editor, modify the Nessus

/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.tenablesecurity.nessusd.plist file and add the following
lines. Do not modify any of the existing lines.
<string>--no-root</string>
<key>UserName</key>
<string>nonprivuser</string>

11. Using sysctl, verify the following parameters have the minimum values:
$ sysctl debug.bpf_maxdevices
debug.bpf_maxdevices: 16384
$ sysctl kern.maxfiles
kern.maxfiles: 12288
$ sysctl kern.maxfilesperproc
kern.maxfilesperproc: 12288
$ sysctl kern.maxproc
kern.maxproc: 1064
$ sysctl kern.maxprocperuid
kern.maxprocperuid: 1064

12. If any of the values in Step 9. do not meet the minimum requirements, take the following steps
to modify values.
Create a file called /etc/sysctl.conf.
Using the a text editor, edit the systctl.conf file with the correct values found in Step 9.

Example:
$ cat /etc/sysctl.conf
kern.maxfilesperproc=12288
kern.maxproc=1064
kern.maxprocperuid=1064

13. Next, using the launchctl limit command, verify your OS default values.
Example: MacOSX 10.10 and 10.11 values.
$ launchctl

data
stack
core
rss
memlock

14. If any of the values in Step 11. are not set to the default OSX values above, take the following
steps to modify values.
Using the a text editor, edit the launchd.conf file with the correct, default values as shown in
Step 11.
Example:
$ cat /etc/launchd.conf
limit maxproc 709 1064

Note: Some older versions of OSX have smaller limits for maxproc. If your version of OSX supports increasing the limits through /etc/launchctl.conf, increase the value.

15. For all changes to take effect either reboot your system or reload the launch daemon.
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.tenablesecurity.nessusd.plist

Scan Targets
Hostname targets that look like either a link6 target (start with the text "link6") or like one of the two
IPv6 range forms can be forced to be processed as a hostname by putting single quotes around the target.
The following table explains target types, examples, and a short explanation of what happens when
that target type is scanned.
