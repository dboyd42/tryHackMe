[Task 1] What are event logs?
*****************************

Intro
=====

Event logs
	record events taking place in the execution of a system to provide an audit
	trail that can be used to understand the activity of the system and to
	diagnose problems.  They are essential to understand the activities of
	complex systems, particularly in applications with little user interaction
	(such as server applications).

	[+] Event logs can also be usefule to combine log file entries from
	multiple sources.  This approach, in combination with statistical analysis,
	may yield correlations between seemingly unrelated events on different
	servers.

SIEMs (Security Information and Event Managment): Splunk, Elastic
	allows you to query the logs from multiple devices instead of manually
	connecting to a single device to view its logs.

Syslog
	Linux and macOS name/version for their logging system.
